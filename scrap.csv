0,"I feel so guilty for taking ""mental health days"" off work","Yep, same. Also confounded by the anxiety of losing my job if I take too many days off. It’s hell at work, it’s hell if I stay home. Just hell."
1,"Ive finally realised, I dont want to kill myself, I just want to let myself die","I've been there too. I stopped going to school, stopped eating, stopped cleaning myself. I lay in bed and hated knowing that if I killed myself I would just create even more problems for my family. My parents were already at each other's throats and did not need any more ammunition on each other. I promised myself that if I could just wait until I was 18, I could move out and disappear without anyone being able to blame anyone else. So I held on by my fingernails. I remember my mom had to put me in the shower and spend an hour combing out the big knots in my hair because I never brushed it or cleaned it properly.

  
 When I turned 18 I dropped out of school completely and applied for work. My plan was to move out and then drown myself in the sea (as it was close and I had considered jumping in front of a train but that became so messy for other people and I didn't want to be a bother). Then I got a job abroad. I moved there and suddenly there were all these opportunities to do all the things I'd never done. I found people who cared about and supported me. I still wished I could disappear but my plans to die went away. I still had days where I was tempted to step out in front of a bus or train or hop into the river and drown but I learned to keep postponing it: ""I'll sleep on it and if I still wanna die tomorrow I can think about it again."" or ""I'll have pizza one more time before I go."" I'd always get distracted by something. 

  
 I'm 28 now and I still want to disappear some days. But I've learned that this suicidal ideation is a distorted thinking that my brain has been programmed to do since my depression and that these are not clear, logical thoughts. I'm an adult and I can take control of my life. There's always at least a third option between staying where I am and death. Now I disrupt my thoughts with something: a song, a more positive challenge to those thoughts, pictures of cute animals, what would Catwoman do etc. Then I write down my darker thoughts when I have some me time. Distract, process and then move on. It has helped me a lot and I'm in a much better place physically as well as mentally. I hope there's something you can take from this that might encourage you. Digging yourself out of depression is a long and difficult process but each breath of fresh air is totally worth it. There is so much beauty in the world and it is happy to have you here."
2,I dont know if this is a worse problem than I think it is,"You should talk more with your therapist about it. Paranoia is a bit different than social anxiety and even if it is it's much more in a different class than severe anxiety. To me that's not anxiety.

Make sure to talk with the T next visit!  :)"
3,Anyone ever overthink and worry about things you can’t control causing so much anxiety where it affects you physically?,"Yeah to an extent. I find myself feeling nauseous at times of high stress and loss of appetite. 

In what way does your stress affect you physically?"
4,DAE get chest pains?,"Two years ago, I wore a holter (sp?) for a month because of random chest pains and my heart doing the funky chicken. It’s anxiety. I always figured anxiety was what you felt in your stomach, turns out, it can be in your chest too. I think it’s called angina."
5,Breakdown,I don't have any advice because i have know idea how to manage my own life i just wanted to tell you that you arent alone and that i really hope you get through it and can be happy.
6,the future scares me to the point where I don't see myself living in it.,"Hey I feel you man. Hope it gets better soon. For me what's been working is one foot in front of the other, every day. Hasn't been easy though. Hope it all works out for both of us"
7,Why isn’t there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?,"I’ve wondered this, myself, for years. I think that a lot of people could benefit from walk-in mental health clinics

I looked it up again just now and it looks like a mental health management company called Beacon opened a walk-in mental health clinic inside of a Walmart in Texas late last year, which sounds fascinating

It would be amazing if this could become a trend and makes mental health care more accessible because when I first started getting help for my issues the whole process sounded confusing and scary. Not to mention, I had social anxiety that was so bad that I could barely make phone calls and would either put them off for as long as I could or not make them at all

I do think that this future is coming. Unfortunately, there is still so much stigma associated with mental health that many people barely want to acknowledge that these issues exist"
8,I have serious concerns my friend might kill himself and I don't know what to do.,My first thought is to contact your friend’s family/anyone who is actually with him right now who could be in closer reach to assist him with any help he needs. Let them know your concerns and maybe see if anyone can talk to him/be there for him physically until you get back.
9,things don’t feel real,"You're suffering from post traumatic dissociation. Sounds like depersonalisation or derealisation which are normal things to feel after a traumatic event. Your brain still has some unprocessed trauma and keeps dissociating to protect itself from it. You could benefit from talking to your doctor, see if you can get some councilling or therapy. Things will eventually get better, even if they start getting worse first."
10,munchausen syndrome??,"This very well could be Munchausen Syndrome, however, I nor most people on here are not licensed to give you this diagnosis.  Nor is the internet in general.  I'm not sure how old you are, but you always have the option of trying psychiatry for medications, and counseling to talk about all of the things bothering you that may cause you to seek all of this attention by doing negative things.  My dear, hurting yourself, or starving yourself just for the attention isn't the way.  It might get you attention, but as I understand from reading this, it's not positive attention.  I would strongly urge you to seek counseling.  You may not realize this, but by ""faking"" things such as anorexia and things like that, you could potentially end up with something like that as an accidental result.  It sounds as though you have some deep-seated issues, that could really use some professional attention.  No matter what kind of abuse you've been through, either physical or mental, it can break you more than you know.  Going to counseling has brought many things up for me, that have helped me realize why I have the anxiety issues that I do, and have helped me to work through them.  Just food for thought.  I hope things get better for you!"
11,Excessive Sweating - Tips?,I find it works best to stay hydrated and if you’re really hot drink ice water. It sounds obvious but I swear cooling yourself from within works. I had to make a conscious effort to make this happen more often. Run cold water over your wrist to cool down. An old coworker told me that and i think that works well. Feels good too if you’re overheated 🥵
12,Can’t seem to stop unhealthy habits in order to cope,"People often use weed as a treatment for depression. Do you find that your weed use impacts your ability to function in society? If so, it’s unhealthy. If not, then I’m not convinced it’s unhealthy"
13,Anyone tried DBT program? What exactly is DBT?,"It’s mostly about gaining skills for daily life. With that you will generally process things that come up with your one-on-one therapist and come up with skills that will help you deal with similar issues in the future. But you are correct in thinking that it is mostly a skills group.

I wouldn’t discount it though; if your therapist thinks it will help you it’s likely for a good reason."
14,Anybody else feel like friends don't love you as much as you love them?,"I always feel like I have a very close bond with someone and will do anything for them, and the second I go into a depressive episode and start staying home more, I don’t hear another word. I just cycle through friends between low points. I’ve never once been reached out to and asked if I’m ok."
15,"Is there such a thing as a ""multiple personality disorder"" that doesn't involve dissociation?",We all snap into different moods and display more of certain sides of our personalities at certain times. Could be a result of anxiety or bipolar.
16,My wife has BPD,"www.dbtselfhelp.com , google ‘ websites for relatives of BPD’ , apparently‘Walking on eggshells ‘ is good for relatives , , good luck on your journey."
17,Deep rooted trauma and unmeasurable bad feelings towards people,"Update: the feeling stopped after about 2 hours and now I no longer feel any type of resentment over anyone. I’m back to feeling calm and loving . Also almost as a sign of god i realized I might be some form of a person with high functioning bipolar but idk. I’ve had these mood swings for 2-4 years. Also I might delete this post because as I said before I am a privacy freak. I have these sudden mood swings about 3 maybe 5 times a week. I mostly go from feeling calm and happy to not being able to think correctly, Feeling like people are faking a personality, and just feeling sad and blaming it on things that happened in the past. Currently I no longer feel this way and I actually had a conversation with my parents and told them I loved them. Also sorry for the awkward style of typing I’m on my phone so yeahh"
18,Should I buy a Nokia 3330?,"Some while ago I read/watch about a smartphone that only did the essentials  (phone, text, whatsapp) and a few more, maybe that would fit what you need better. 
 Maybe they put it under 'minimalist phone' or something like that."
19,How to deal with CPTSD ?,"DBT  recommended by N.I.C.E., national institute of clinical excellence in the NHS - Britain, recommended in NZ and Australia 
ReadMarsha Linehans books 
 Try www.dbtselfhelp.com , used by consumers and writing based on Marsha’s works, first become skilled in emotional skills then move to the CBT  part , EMDR  is also used but not always accessible due to general lack of skilled therapists."
20,"Anxiety, depression, university and jobs advice needed ASAP","I think you worry too much. Sometimes it can be good to take a step back and take perspective of your situation.

It’s important to remember that you’re NOT stuck. You can go back to uni or you can get another job. You always have that option.

I’m not sure how long you’ve been working at the bank but my dad would tell me to take it easy, maybe let someone there know that your a bit uncomfortable with handling so much money and ask for advice from your boss. Anxiety is often made worse in your head and talking about it with other people might put things in perspective. 

When you’re feeling more comfortable at the bank maybe keep working for a year while you figure out what it is you really want to do. You don’t need friends at your workplace, you
only need to be friendly with them. At my last job, I didn’t fit in with my co-workers at all. But I was always ready for a joke, lend a hand or drink a beer with them on friday evenings (we had night shifts and having a beer during was allowed). Being a good co-worker is more important than being their friend.
Depending on your financial situation you can save up some money and always go back to uni and follow a course you really like, or you can find a different place to work. I have 30 year old dudes walking around my uni and no one thinks it’s weird.

Take a breath, you have plenty of options. Figuring out what to do with your life is often stressful, but life is water, not stone. You are never completely stuck."
21,Dumb Question,"I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert, but it sounds like you're going through some sort of depression. I suffer from similar things on a different level, and it's usually worse if I'm more depressed. 

As for a remedy, I'm still trying to figure that out myself, but seeing a specialist or counselor may help you zone in on the issue and work past it."
22,How do I forgive myself for the past ten years?,"I'm 28 now, I've had one job for 6 months for the entirety of my life, and got out of an emotionally abusive 8 year relationship that started when I was 18 to realise I've made not much ""superficial"" progress... I go through this struggle some days, it is hard. The only thing you can do is try to be nice to yourself, think about the things you learned or the experience you gained otherwise. You don't have to jump straight into being more successful overnight, just try and do little things here and there to build up your own self worth. You just have to love yourself regardless of those other things that happened to you. It doesn't make you any less of a person than your peers, and age is just a number in the end!"
23,Did I just have a brief manic episode???,"First off, breathe. Sit down and think it through. Second, don’t self diagnose yourself. For all you know it could be caffeine, one hour less of sleep, bipolarity, the point is you’ll never know. I recommend mentioning it to a doctor or professional in the medical field. If it happens again, immediately seek medical attention."
24,"I went to a really racist high school and now I feel racist being in the army. In Mexican and I have a hard time saying the word nigga when others use it to me, and I can't ask them not to use it cause I know I'm Mexican. And if I don't use it I seem like a bitch","Stick to your morals, what you feel is right in this situation. Others may not enjoy that or dislike you, but at the end of the day it's about whether you like you. Whether you'd respect yourself if you met you."
25,Jobs and mental health,"Hello from a fellow Phoenician, I was diagnosed with PTSD, Severe Depression, anxiety, and a minor psychosis disorder, as well as severe adhd. I am also on medication to manage all of this but I’ve found that food service is the best option. I’m assuming you’re not looking for a career here, in which case there is a plethora of options, but I work in the kitchen at McDonald’s. Minimal interaction with customers, you make great friends in the workplace, and if you can get past the bit of stress that any job can bring, then I think this would work for you. But that’s just my opinion, good luck in your search!

Edit: I saw your comment on McDonald’s pay, many of the AGK franchise stores will offer competitive pay, as well as regular raises and opportunities for promotion if you are productive in the workplace"
26,Housing of emotional support animal?,"Maybe it'd be better to have your dog stay with your parents, so she can have her dog with her, as he is an emotional support animal"
27,I am chronically suicidal. How do I live with this? I want to die.,"I don't have a fix all answer but what helps me cope with the constant feelings of wanting to escape the pain of everyday life is that no matter what i know someone cares about me enough that if i did end up taking my life they would have to carry that hurt with them for the rest of their life and that makes me feel ""bad"" so to speak about hurting people around me. You definitely shouldn't guilt trip yourself but just take solace in the fact that no matter how lonely things seem there is always someone who's life is intertwined with yours even if you aren't aware of it. Things will not always be perfect and there will be rough times but to me even if I'm in pain at least i can still feel because numbness is worse then any pain I've ever experienced.  If you ever want to talk about anything or just vent to relieve some of your pain I'm here for you and care for you even though i dont know you but i respect you as a fellow human being."
28,Therapy concerns.,"I do have the same feeling, but still I've decided to continue, maybe these sessions help me somewhat"
29,Positive vibes please,Funny Netflix shows. Animal cuddles. Listening to soothing sounds or podcasts. Knowing brighter times are ahead. Getting into a counselor is the first step! You go!
30,Are these a sign of a breakdown of some sorts? if so what kind?,"I have had the same experience, I could just barely hear my own thought if at all. Definitely scary, been wondering what that meant as well. Hope you get an answer to this."
31,I keep seeing weird shadows in the corner of my eye?,You're not getting enough sleep. Ghosts are fake
32,Need advice and help,"Don’t see them and what is Pantone , apart from a paint matching company??"
33,I think I’ve got an eating disorder and I need help,"You should consider talking to a doctor about it. Not a psychologist though, I think there are pills for that. Otherwise, I don't know if you can really do anything else."
34,Sad,"I hope things get better for you. Thank you for leaving this message. I hope wherever they are, they are at peace. May you have peace soon as well."
35,I can't do this anymore. I feel used.,If you ever need to talk to someone I'm always here for anyone in need because i know the pain of being alone. I will just listen judgement free if you need someone to vent to so you don't feel alone because no one deserves that.
36,Lexapro gave me back my old self.,">Panic attacks, shivering despite not being cold, teeth rattling, cold sweats, stomach problems, being spaced out, needing a chaperon to leave the house, not being able to drive alone, impending sense of doom, suicidal thoughts, secluding yourself from friends and family, self-loathing, trouble going through house chores

&#x200B;

I'm also diagnosed with GAD.

Ironically, for me Lexapro made almost everything listed there worse as a side effect when I started taking it. I've been off it for about 7 months now and the seemingly random cold sweats and shivering still haven't gone away.

&#x200B;

That stuff almost ruined my life, but I'm happy it works for you.

Mental health medications are weird yo."
37,Feeling of wanting to hurt yourself,"I had the need to hurt myself sometimes when I was in a very stressful situation where I felt like I deserved to be punished, to feel pain. Or just to get my mind out of the super stressful back into the present. 

My psychologist said that I could carry an elastic around my wrist and snap that when I felt like hurting myself. This is a non invasive way of channeling the 'need'. 

Please go visit a psychologist or a doctor and talk about it. This kinds of feelings warrant a visit to a therapist."
38,I Believe Something Terrible Happened To Me When I Was A Child,"It’s definitely possible. Sometimes the brain will block things out in order to cope with it. I’m very sorry if something did happen, but it might be worth it to talk about it with a professional, if you’re comfortable."
39,Constant fatigue? (F17),Might want to check your iron levels. Having low iron can cause a lot of fatigue
40,Why are panic attacks simultaneously one of the worst and best experiences? (late 20s),"I think that’s great that yours end in clarity. I actually am very similar, 26 years old, weed started inducing panic attacks so I stopped smoking, and I have baseline anxiety but few and far between panic attacks.

I also had one of the worst ones of my life yesterday, and was driving and almost called 911. I instead called my dad hysterically crying that I was dying begging him to call 911. He told me to come get a Xanax, lol. It helped. Today though, I did not feel clear. My ass was kicked from the panic attack, and maybe Xanax too? Idk last night after I started to come down from it I was just shot and had a good dinner and watched a crappy lifetime movie lol. 

What happened w yours? Mine started like a normal panic attack, then my hands and feet went numb, and my lip started twitching. My heart was (obvi) beating soooo fast so I was sweating so much, then my hands locked up. Meanwhile I was like I said, driving. I was like oh fuck this is it I’m gonna die. When I got out of my car I was barely able to walk, if my dad wasn’t in my recent calls I don’t think my hands would have worked to unlock my phone and call his number, I was lucky I was able to do it all from my steering wheel. Panic attacks are the worst things ever!!! I envy your clarity you get after, and I wish that would happen to me!! Happy you’re okay :)"
41,Why do I act this way to treatment,"I know tons of people who go to IOP.

The best solution is to assess what's happening before, during and after in your head. What are you thinking before you go to IOP? What are you thinking during IOP? What are you thinking after IOP? Whatever it may be connected to something else.

Really you should talk to a therapist or psychiatrist about this. That's what's best."
42,"Need some advise on a depression situation(pretty long,sorry in advance)","Sorry to hear that you've joined the depression club.

Antidepressants are not addictive. If you stop taking them for whatever reason, there are no cravings. I've been on and off several before I found one that worked. Most people find something that works sooner than that though!

Cognitive behavioural therapy might help too - you might ask your doctor about that.

Re: exercise. When you're depressed, anything that isn't lying down counts as exercise."
43,"I [19f] kind of need to vent and that’s okay and if anyone has advice for me, it is welcome","You won’t be bad at something that you focus on. Find your focus. You have recognized your rock bottom point and have come a long way. 

You should also tell your therapist because therapy doesn’t work unless you work it like it does. 

You are beautiful and you can only see yourself in the mirror. Make the voices in your head like you and compliment you. Also, please exercise so that you create endorphins in your brain. It’s the best antidepressant and the most underused."
44,Losing interest,"I'm sorry you're in this situation - but I think you already know the answer here. My advice would be to have a sit-down with her, talk to her about your concerns. See if it goes anywhere; maybe she's genuinely not realizing how you feel. Or maybe you've just reached the end of the road together and it's time to move on. Either way, IMO your best course of action here is not to suffer in silence but actually talk to your GF. <<<hugs>>>"
45,"I'm pretty confident I have Bipolar II, how should I tell my doctor when I see him?","Most primary care doctors are familiar with common mood disorders like bipolar, depression, and anxiety. You could probably see any doctor and they'd be able to get treatment started. If your family has money, seeing a psychiatrist is a great choice for a diagnosis as they're the best at catching more complex cases.

You need to see a doctor about it as soon as you can especially if the suicidal thoughts are persistent. Make sure that you disclose the suicide attempt to the doctor - it's important diagnostic information."
46,Am I a bad person or a bitch?,"You have to protect yourself, your not a bad person."
47,I keep setting myself up for failure and I don’t know how to stop,"I used to joke with people that always asked me when I would stop smoking cigarettes. I always replied back ""I ain't no quitter"" 

And then I quit. But I got myself a tattoo as a reminder and signed up for like 3x 5ks to instill that notion."
48,What would your doctor do if you're both suicidal and homicidal and you have plans to carry them out?,Put you in inpatient
49,"Just because everything looks great on the outside, does not mean I'm doing great on the inside","Take care of yourself man. I think you should draw a line before it consumes you completely. I also think your parents are being abusive towards your good intentions. They should be happy, proud, grateful and nothing else. With the life you're living I hardly believe you have any tiny bit of brain storage space to think peacefully about things that concern you. I understand it will not be easy, but you ve clearly worked your ass off to have the things you do. Take a deep breath, move out, make your mother a financial schedule and take them out to dinner once a week. Good luck"
50,Reddit is Ruining your Mental Health,"Since I come here for emotional support outside of therapy I have to wholeheartedly disagree. But I don't really use Reddit the way many do or even I used to myself anymore. 
I think the actual problem is that the analog world has generally gone to shit since we've all been preoccupied online, and the newest influx of kids has grown up with it going to shit like that so they totally suck.  

My gen needed several kinds of financial aid and releif it didn't get, so here we are, being shit at life. Both on Reddit and elsewhere."
51,Me venting about all of my current issues to organize them and be able to sleep.,"This is crazy relatable for me, I was just in a mood similar to this recently and am starting to feel better. If you read this in the morning you probs won’t care but come the night time if you’re stressing or whatever feel free to message me cos we sound very similar and maybe having a stranger who understands will help a little. I’ve found that the best way to start feeling better is talking to someone, for me it was random redditors and my girlfriend however I kind of took it out on her at the same time so I think strangers is the best option. You ain’t alone pal, and write your scripts at night when you’re feeling mad creative, they’re always the best ones :)"
52,Are there any of you who have been forced to stay living at home due to your illness causing problems with getting a good enough job to support yourself?,"i am just a few years from turning 30 and still live with my parents. interestingly, my reasons seem to be quite opposite to yours.

i am not able to be in one place for more than a couple hours without my anxiety spiking. just the thought of working 4-8 hour shifts on a regular basis stresses me out. i also can not imagine having a job where i have extended periods of not being stimulated by others in some way, because i fear being left alone with my mind.

as i get older, i am coming to terms with these characteristics of myself--but it is a slow process. i often feel like a failed adult, or ""less than,"" because of the mental instability i deal with. i often wonder if i need to pursue serious treatment for my mental issues beyond the medication i take, then i question whether i am just being dramatic and need to get over myself.

i decided to go back to college about 3 years ago and this makes me feel like i am working towards something important that may help me reach a point where i can work a more ""normal"" job (instead of being self-employed and working less than 20h a week). but the memories of previous breakdowns due to being overwhelmed with work/school are always present.

this may not help you at all, but i just wanted to reach out and say you're not alone in your situation. life can be rough in so many different ways."
53,Seeing doctor to get help for the first time.,"I think this is probably hard, but try to be authentic. I know it's weird to let out your vulnerability, but the great thing about a psychologist is they are probably the least judgmental person you can talk to - because they have no other connection to you. I personally really appreciate therapy, and it's helped me a lot. As long as you try to be honest, even if that means just saying a few things, small or big things, therapy can help."
54,anybody else just know they are a terrible selfish person?,"Feel you!
I kinda feel a fraud a lot of times *exactly* because if this.

Tho I don't really solved it yet ay"
55,Getting Married in 2 days &amp; suffering with reactive depression: advice needed please.,"Apart from telling you to go seek behavioral therapy/some other highly respected kind of therapy:

- Clean Diet
- (aerobic/anaerobic) cardio
- Meditation

all have observable effects on stress-reduction (cortisol & inflammation that reaches the brain via digestion)

If your life is awesome but still you aren't feeling well, going on med's short-term might be a proper option as well.
I know it doesn't help but let me express my admiration for what you have accomplished so far, it's actually **amazing.** Sadly, it seems more like the norm to become entrenched in nihilism or lethargy when growing up poor instead of working hard like you did!


I remember this bit from a Podcast about the part with joining the military:


[Advice If You Regret Not Joining The Military - Jocko Willink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLEqoJPHvgY)"
56,When will you start to become a quieter person?,"I've been through a lot of things since a was 8. However I'm a introvert as far as I can remember!.

When I was a kid I usually didn't like to hug or kiss any member of my family, also I used to do things alone and still to be honest.

So while my teens, I realized that being a introvert wasn't that great as at that time I'd like to make friends and so on. Then I tried to interact with classmates and even neighbors, made a couple of friends and had a ""less weird"" teens.

The turning point for me was when I reached 20. Some of my problems came back haunt me! So I became anxious and depressed... I'd say it was the worst time of my life til now! In short, I  became as introvert as I was during childhood, and in my opinion being quieter was a crucial thing to keep myself, somehow, good.

&#x200B;

Anyway I still struggle with some problems in life... it really sucks! However being quiet, introvert or whatever you want to name it, made me stronger! Maybe the reason is that you won't have a lot of interactions to manage, or, MAYBE it is the most comfortable way to live(at least in my case) .

&#x200B;

Peace!"
57,"I’m experiencing hallucinations, is this anxiety?",It's rare but severe anxiety cann cause hallucinations or paranoia
58,I don't know what is wrong with me help.,"First of all, you're not alone. I've been going through the same for many years.

Whenever I am dealing with a period of stress or uncertainty I become suicidal. I have insured myself many times.

&#x200B;

I might sound really negative now, and I know everyone is different, but counseling hasn't really helped me. I tried a few different times, with different therapist.

Still, counseling / therapy obviously does help a lot of people. If you can maybe try talk to your parents about it and they could maybe drive you?

The only thing that helps me is to push forward, think of my dreams, and do everything to make them true. Maybe think of whatever you are passionate about or what you want to achieve.

And give yourself time. ""It's okay not to be okay"". Many people suffer from the same / similar things, you're not alone ! <3

&#x200B;

Maybe force yourself to go outside (I know it's difficult when you are feeling like this), but maybe there is a bus to town? It's always good to talk to people, or just be among people. It always helps me... but it always takes very long until I move my ass and go outside."
59,What can I do?,""" All they've done is give me medication for it, and get me a therapist-""  this is the treatment for mental illness, exactly what they've done."
60,When do you know to seek professional help?,"I struggled with similar situations a few points in my life and asked similar questions and to be honest talking to my family really helped me decide whether seeking professional help was the right path in each situation. 

At the end of the day, I lean toward going to my doctor or therapist while also talking things through with my family. Resources constraints sometimes get in the way of that plan, but that is what I try to do path when I am not certain."
61,Doctors won't prescribe pot to treat mood swings and anxiety. Anyone know a strain that could possibly be beneficial?,Post this in r/MMJ. They should be able to help
62,I think people who make jokes/say that people need to “man up” or “grow a pair” or “be a man” are part of the problem.,"Yeah, the general vibe is 

""Take your fucking man-problems somewhere else and die, but don't make us listen to it"""
63,"Hearing voices when I'm really tired or half awake. Sometimes they are so loud, they wake me up. It doesn't bother me but should I be worried?","Hypnopompic and hypnagogic hallucinations are completely and utterly normal. Just very freaky to experience.

My personal favourite was when I hallucinated a tarantula on my wall. It was the size of my wall. And about 2ft from my face. I am an arachnophobe. That was a good time."
64,Weekly CBT Therapy sessions the norm?,common in the US.
65,How many of us are truly mentally healthy?,"I think the difference there is that literally everybody has issues like this (occasionally procrastinating, not always having the best impulse control, etc). That's just part of being human and doesn't mean you're mentally unhealthy. Something is classified as a mental illness once it starts to impede normal functioning/daily life. So someone who is occasionally sad is mentally healthy, but someone who is constantly sad regardless of what's going on in their life could be diagnosed with a mental illness (depression). It's all about the degree to which the issue affects you."
66,What is the meaning of life + stuff,"I got back into a hobby I loved when I was younger. The community (on reddit and irl) is amazing and I can just geek out with them about it. Really made me a lot happier.

The real human meaning of life is to be happy. Otherwise there is no point. Figure out what is making you unhappy. The sooner you do, the sooner you can fix that problem. 

I fell pretty deep into the pit. I stayed home all day drinking. But when I realized what was making me unhappy I decided to fix those aspects. Now I’m in the process, I already feel a lot better about myself and my life.

You already did the first step (posting here). I’d advice writing down everything that’s making you unhappy and figure out what the solution to those problems could be. If you can’t figure it out, find professional help. It’ll help a lot, trust me.

You owe it to yourself to be happy, always remember that."
67,I feel like such a disappointment...,Who is it you feel you are disappointing? Depending on the answer I might have some advice.
68,My girlfriend is insecure about a lot of things how do I help her?,"Just continue to be there for her. Compliment her always. Take her out to do fun things (hikes, walks, etc. Doesnt have to cost money). Tell her all of the little things she does that you love. Most im sure she doesnt even realize she does. Do tred lightly though. If its something she may feel insecure about, dont be as upfront about it. Just imply that those things are things that you find great about her. If theres anythong she wants to change about herself, motivate her and even offer to do those things with her (if possible)."
69,I am withdrawing from ALL my medications.,"Talk with your doctor, a sudden withdrawal could have some really bad effects. Or try to take a smaller dose than they have given you."
70,What’s the diagnosis process?,"You could go to a different psychiatrist/therapist for a second opinion. Some therapists don’t like to put labels on people so may refuse to officially diagnose. Others are too quick to diagnose. I expect it would take at least a few sessions for a professional to be confident enough to diagnose a personality disorder. 

A personality disorder is a label given to a particular set of symptoms/behaviors. To say that you “have something” is really just to say that you exhibit a particular set of symptoms and I personally don’t find the label particularly useful because it isn’t necessary to address the issues. However, I do completely understand wanting an official diagnosis. It can bring a kind of peace of mind. I think the problem with labeling people with personality disorders is that they sometimes then put the responsibility onto the disorder (like, “I do that behavior because of my X Personality Disorder”) as if it’s its own entity."
71,Too smiley to be taken seriously,"Well, according to my friends I seem happy and normal and outgoing.

whenever I tell anyone about my depression and anxiety, they don't believe me. It's horrible."
72,I've seen two therapists and they both have the same method that is completely unhelpful to me. Advice?,Find someone who specializes in ptsd and trauma.
73,You're getting bette each day! Dont give up!!!!,No I' m not
74,Mental Health Research Questions!!,"On a daily basis, I take time for self care of some kind, big or small. Could be having  a bowl of ice cream or making time to watch a movie or game. Even just getting a new tattoo is my extra special self care treat. 

In terms of what I do, sometimes weed works. Usually it's making time to get outside. Backpacking and climbing are big helpers for me mentally. Gives me focus and doesn't allow my brain to run rampant. What's been unhelpful is usually stuff that requires me to sit calmly and meditate. Just not something I can do personally."
75,Issues with living a purposeful life. Just looking to talk to.... anyone.,"To be honest, this whole situation Is brought on by your mental health symptoms, simply because it is a non-issue. Like, it’s not a problem at all, your anxiety and depression are what the problem is. 

It’s 100% natural and accepted that if you find a better job than the one you’re working in, you give 2 weeks notice and move on. Nothing could be more simple, natural, and socially accepted than that. I have actually left jobs with less than 2 weeks notice, because the new job was more important and wanted me to start earlier. And it was never a problem.  Never!

Everyone understands that people want better jobs, so it’s natural that people change jobs when they are no longer satisfied with their current one. There’s nothing more understandable than wanting a good/better job. No one ever (or very few people, I don’t know) stay in the jobs they dislike because of sense of loyalty, that actually sounds strange and counterintuitive. 

I was surprised to read that you’ve turned down so many jobs already because of a verbal agreement! Dude, even if this agreement was written and notarized, you’d still have the right to leave with due notice. The agreements are not made to bind you to work for your employer for X of time, *they are a guarantee that the employer won’t fire you before X time passes. * Do you see the difference?

I’m guessing you’re nervous because this is a family business and you’re afraid of disappointing your family members? But that doesn’t actually make that much sense either, because if you get your dream job, this guarantees better financial situation for your family and better life for you and your family. Wouldn’t your wife’s uncle rather have his niece and her husband prospering even though it means he would lose an employee? Besides, he will be able to hire a replacement soon, which is for the better, because your replacement will actually enjoy the job, unlike you. Know what I mean?

Finally, if your wife’s uncle was not understanding and got mad at you, which would be extremely weird, why should he be allowed to make decisions about your personal life? It’s none of his business where you work! It seems like he lent you a hand when you couldn’t find a proper job, so now that you can find the job of your dreams, why would you stay?

ETA: I just read your last sentence about your family being against you switching jobs. I’m curious to why that is? It’s a complete mystery to me why they try to prevent you from being more successful! Either way, the same principle applies - you are your own person and you deserve to make your own path to success!"
76,Withdrawal from anti depressants,"This can be really awful to come off cold turkey. You need to ring your gp ASAP. A phone call should be enough to sort out a dosage and prescription. If things are really bad then 111 is also an option (if your in the uk). Please do not wait. I had horrific withdrawals from an antidepressant and it was physical and mental and it made me very ill and unsafe. Your dr will have dealt with this many times. Be honest and open, they need to know so they can advise you best."
77,Is it normal to think about suicide daily?,"If you think of suicide often, then it might get to where you accept it more as a possibility and something that would be easy to do. If you can, it might be good for you to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist at least once."
78,OCD??,"OCD is an anxiety based disorder, and it is often a thousand times worse when you are stressed.

OCD also has a pretty high comorbidity rate with other anxiety issues, and the irrational thoughts that you described in your first few sentences can be a result of those issues as well (BTDT myself).

Intrusive thoughts are also very normal for OCD, OP.

&#x200B;

It does get better with age, and oddly enough constant exposure to stressful situations. When I was a kid, it was pretty bad. As I got older it got better and now (almost 30) it is something that I know is always lurking in the background, but it doesn't jump out unless I am either super bored or super stressed. Even then I have learned to control it to a pretty good extent. My best advice to you would be to figure out your stressors, so that you can either avoid them if possible or work through and desensitize yourself to them."
79,How to make counseling work with a FT job?,"Hi there.  It depends on where you live but I know that in US, Canada and most of Western Europe you can have your counselor provide documentation that you have a disability and require an accommodation to allow you to miss work at times for appointments.  You should also know that you do not need to disclose a diagnosis or what kind of appointments they are."
80,Should I talk to my boss about my mental health?,"I've been in somewhat similar situation. I am a teacher and I tried to address my depression and anxiety with two different employers. The first time I had a small emotional breakdown and left to cry outside after my class had been dismissed. My principal came to me and seemed to make an earnest attempt to understand what was going on. I appreciated this a lot at the time because he was a really socially awkward person but he approached me in a way let me know it was safe to open up.
He didn't make a big deal of it, just asked to make sure I was getting the help I needed and offered me as much time off as I required to get back on track. 

My new principal, however, would crack really unfunny jokes on the regular. Awkward jokes that out everyone on edge. He was like Michael Scott IRL. One joke about EOG test scores in particular triggered by anxiety and I asked him to stop for that reason. 
His first response was to make a joke about me shooting up the school. His second was to compare my scores to a different teachers (who teaches a different subject in a different grade). I don't know if he was trying to make me feel bad about struggling with anxiety but he did a great job doing so. I resigned from the county this year based on that conversation.

Like you, I struggle with eloquently talking about my anxiety and depression unless it's with other people who are struggling. If your boss is easy going, I'd take a shot at talking with them. I felt so much better knowing my first principal understood that I was struggling and that he had my back.

That being said, I wouldn't wish what I went through with my second principal. That talk really took a toll on me and stuck in my head the rest of the school year. 

what should you do next depends entirely on how comfortable you are speaking with your boss. If you think they're the type of person that would have your back, I'd go for it. It's a tough call to make."
81,Short Question: Can you be shy and extroverted?,"I’m kind of similar. When I’m in certain social situations I almost completely shut down and have nothing to say, I’m always embarrassed after I have dinner with my boyfriend’ parents because I hardly speak. 

And sometimes I can command a room, I can get everybody going, have them laughing, and even be told to calm down. I’m also very charming in job interviews, but everyday interactions (bartenders, cashiers, etc) I struggle to even seem normal. 

So I guess you can be? But I don’t know what causes it."
82,body dysmorphia and food,"Well. ED is nasty to deal with because telling anything body/food related just doesn’t register in the brain, the person just sees/thinks what he/she does. I had several years when my eating disorder was my main focus in life (im glad thats already almost 10 years ago, but i can still only say im in remission because i feel that deep down  the urge is still there and idk what would happen if i suddenly gained more weight than i think is acceptable for me). So, try to get her counseling, therapy and the sooner the better. As much as i have observed eating disorders (and often anxiety disorders) stem from the feeling of not being good enough, not being lovable enough etc, the best is to provide lots of affirmative, caring, loving words (not related to eating behavior or looks), unconditional love and show it trough actions. Less critique, complaining or expectations which sometimes sneaks in conversations even between other family members and the child might only be the observant that gets affected. Ofc she my have problems outside family that have triggered this but strong family bonds are essential to get over this. Good luck. If you need to talk you can dm me anytime."
83,I want to volunteer for a mental health organisation.,I'm in the same position. I'm told insight is a good thing but I'm not sure if I'm resilient enough
84,How do you do it?,"I need to clean too, want to do it together?

Put on some music or a podcast.  Think about how much better you'll feel when it's done.


Most of all, just get your ass up and do it!  ;)

If you need specifics, send me some screenshots of what you want to clean and I'll give you more tips."
85,Socially anxious in Seattle,"Hey there!  Just wanted to tell you that I read your story.

Have you tried getting professional help?  It sounds like you're attempting to tackle this on your own, which is admirable but not nearly as effective as seeing a trained professional who can help you deal with these things.

Keep me updated on your progress.  :)"
86,Obsession,"It totally can be normal, don’t worry. Especially if your a teenager, anxiety about love interests is a normal part of growing up. The advice I’d give would be to learn to love yourself. Guys like confidence more than anything else. If you feel comfortable with who you are, you won’t need someone else to make you feel loved/beautiful. Which I feel like may be the root of your anxiety.

Be confident, and guys will be texting you no doubt."
87,are other forms of self harm just as serious as the big one?,"Self harm is well.. self harm. In books it talks about hitting, scratching, punching, biting, etc. Cutting is more normalized I guess. Through schools and society it is more common more heard of. People do know that scratching and all that is self mutilation. In these days teens with some struggles can cut - parents finds out - it spreads- media. People who struggle for a bit do a bit more either cut more burn hit ,-so on.

People don't go to the doctor because they hit themself bruise scratch. Some do either on purpose or forced. Normally they don't want people to find out. You cannot hide if you have cuts on your flesh though, if it's found others will know that you did it. Not like having bruises or by having patchy hair or by acting off.

It's truly sad that it isn't talked too much about."
88,I am lonely,"I'm sorry. I'm also sorry that I dont have any answers or tips for you. I can only say that I understand completely. I've been there, and it sucks. I know it's not the same, but if you need someone to talk to, I can be your ears. Just know that you're not alone in this situation. I think theres alot of us out there, but in this day in age, it's hard to find em. <3 

<edited: deleted 'If' from end of post."
89,Will I find a medication that helps me?,"I found that when my medication finally had an effect on my anxiety, it was so noticeable even my partner pointed it out (because I was coming out of my shell more, doing things I'd never have done before, agreeing with and to things I'd never have before).

Sometimes we don't get the big world changing, back-to-how-we-were-before effects we dream of. But there should be *some* good effects that make the medication feel worth taking. My new medication dose has done a number on my ability to orgasm, making it somewhere between difficult and impossible especially with a partner. My partner and I are having to really re-evaluate how we're approaching our sex life. But it's worth it for me, because it's helping my anxiety so much."
90,I’m asexual or having a mental illness such as AvPD?,What it sounds like you’re after is a friend. Don’t feel pressured into something you don’t want because it’s a social norm. it’s not a bad thing you’re not in a romantic relationship with some. If that’s not what you want then thats ok.
91,I'm worried all the time,Ive felt this too :o hope seeing the mental health professional will help you and hope it goes well! :)
92,Inability to do things,Break it down into small parts...accomplishing small things will boost your energies to accomplish the whole

94,"Always heard that writing letters with all your feelings about something and then burning or deleting it could help in any aspect, i didn't believe but it really helps. if you are in agony, try, will help you.",I never thought of this. I will have to try it. Thank you :)
95,Calling in sick for mental health reasons,"Sadly, I think you have the right idea. You absolutely should be able to take time off because of mental health issues but the fact is that a lot of employers will use it against you. Unless you’re in a position where you are very well protected (e.g., union, strong HR procedures, access to legal recourse), it’s probably best to take the time but say that the problem is something else."
96,I hate myself,"I strongly advise you go see someone, they are professional when it comes to helping you with any feelings. Please do not do anything harmful to yourself, self harm/suicide is never the answer. I hope everything gets better for you."
97,Feeling so homesick and anxious while studying abroad,"You’re not alone in feeling that way. I went on my study abroad in the UK and it was some lonely times. College all together was pretty lonely even though I was always around people and what not. 
I would just try my best to enjoy being there since it’s not forever and take pictures and experience it all. If you’re homesick for your family or friends, arrange to call them when it’s not too late back whenever they are and they won’t be sleeping.

Maybe you’ll make one good friend at least from your classes to go out to do stuff with! Either way, don’t stay cooped up in the sterile room you have and stuff. Go out and see the world whenever you’re studying abroad at."
98,I'm so close.,"Joshua, I know how you feel. I know that the world might feel like you don't belong in it, but I promise you, you do. I know it can be hard to believe that people love and care about you, but so many people in your life do. I know that it can be hard to see after years of being told differently but it's there. I may not know you directly, but I'm glad that you are a part of this world. I'm glad that you still fighting a fight that so many people struggle with. Please, please, please reconsider your plan.  You think that the world would be a better place without you in it, but I know that there are people like me, that love that you are a part of it. Try and talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling, because you're not the alone. If you need someone to lean on, I'm here <3 I'm a great listener, message me anytime."
99,I need some input here to try and help someone close to me who sees things that are not there as well as has some pretty strange beliefs that are not true of course.,Sounds like psychosis as a symptom of his schizophrenia. He could probably do with chatting with his psychiatrist regarding possibly changing his meds around if it's impacting his daily functioning or social identity
100,What can I [17M] do to help my abuse victim ex-girlfriend [17F]?,"Hey!  Just wanted to let you know I read your story.

First things first.  What the grandfather did is a **CRIME**.  It is not some family disagreement that can/should be kept in-house.  She needs to **CONTACT THE POLICE**, not bring it up to her family.  Especially if they're ignoring her and continuing to expose her to him.  You say her family is overprotective.  That's bullshit.  They're controlling, is what you mean.  They haven't protected her from anything.        

Secondly...  I hate to say this but you should consider cutting your losses on this one.  You said you're 17 and dated her for a month.  It took you six paragraphs to list all the issues with this girl and her family.  That's called a red flag.

What do you see in this girl?  I could be wrong but based on the fact that you say ""we did a lot of shit really fast including getting really physical really quickly"".  Is your interest mainly sexual?  This girl is not ready for a healthy relationship.  

Anyway, keep me posted on how it goes."
101,"Not sure if I’m in crisis, new experience..","Hey!  Just wanted to let you know I read your story.

It sounds like you're going through an anxiety attack.  It's been about fifteen minutes since you posted, so if it's not gone by the time you read this you NEED to seek medical attention.

If it's gone by the time you read this, you STILL need to tell your medical professionals.  This info is very important to them.  It could be a byproduct of your medication, or something else entirely.  Tell someone who is trained to deal with this.

Please keep me updated."
102,Does anybody else feel like they can't tell people about their problems because of how they might come across?,"My therapist told me adults don’t need to make excuses or defend themselves.

You had to make life decisions that work for you and your mom. You know you are in a better mental place where you are now. This is more important than having your own place, things etc.

You are allowed to have problems, no matter how bad someone else has it. 
I recognized I wasn’t the MOST depressed person, but I was depressed. Does this mean I didn’t deserve to seek help, of course not.

Try to be less hard on yourself. 
I find  I’m harder on myself than others are on me. My husband, son and I live with my mother in law. We aren’t very proud of it, but I know we are living more comfortably because of it, and it helps my mother in law too."
103,Feeling different after suicide attempt,"Hey!  Just wanted to let you know that I read your story.

So, first things first, no, what you describe is not normal.  I'm a bit shocked that your doctors have not insisted you do any sort of therapy (instead of just changing your medication).  *YOU* need to be one the to insist on that, if they're not doing it.

Secondly, it sounds like you're going through a rough patch in life.  I can relate to the housing problems.  My wife and I just bought a new house, and thought we had sold our old house, but there were problems with the lender and now we have to pay two mortgages for at least a month.  It was unexpected and is stressing us out a bit.

Having said that, I firmly believe that *it's going to get better*.  I think the same for you.  It's not going to be easy, but just focus on how great things are going to be when you finally get settled in the new house.  You should always have something to look forward to in life.

Keep me updated on how things are going.  :)"
104,Self-love is bullshit. Dump this idea,"Loving myself and being kinder to myself is actually what inspires me to make my life better and to be a better person. I've hated myself most of my life because of abuse I received growing up. I thought of myself as disgusting, unlovable, and worthless. Why even bother trying to be a better person? It's no use. That's how I used to think. 

Having other people love me and show me the value of myself and my life helped motivate me to get better. Treating myself with love and tenderness has inspired me to be more creative, to pursue hobbies, to eat better, be more active, etc etc etc. It's not necessarily a narcissistic trait."
105,I think my boyfriend is depressed and suicidal,"Hey there!  Just wanted to let you know that I read your story.

You might need to pull some tough love.  I know I didn't get help until my wife said it was therapy or a divorce.  

If you think another approach might work better, than do it.  However it is obvious you are at a breaking point and he needs help.  Are you willing to continue without him making any changes?"
106,I am often worried about my partners mental health and how it will affect our future,"Psychotherapy as in Freudian stuff or something that works , EMDR ,"
107,"I dont know, just need to vent, to put this out since i dont have someone i can trust to say this to.","I kind of relate. I was very similar to what you describe as a kid, but then I was always told to conform, to hang out with other kids (even though I had completely different interests), to do well in school even if I didn't care for it (I can over-study any matter that I'm interested in, but not the ones I'm forced to study) and many other things. And so I changed myself a bit. Only after being in therapy and getting diagnosed I started to feel and act like myself again. This society may make you something different, but there is always a chance to find your true self and don't give a damn about expectations. 

(may I ask what the novel is? I love reading, and finding relatable characters is a double plus)"
108,I hate myself and I don’t know why,"Hey.  Just wanted to let you know that I read your story.

It sounds like you know exactly why you hate yourself, and it's not your fault.  It sounds like your mother has some serious issues herself and was never able to get the help she needed to give you the help you need.

You say you're on antidepressants.  Are you also going to therapy?  Antidepressants can help the physical/chemical issues, but you clearly need some psychological intervention as well.

Let me know if you ever need someone to talk to.  I'm on break and have all the time in the world.  :)"
109,URGENT PLEASE CHECK ON THIS GUY AND SEND HIM A MESSAGE. IM WORRIED ABOUT HIM I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE KILLED HIMSELF,I sent him a message hopefully all is well
110,I had a surreal experience last summer that I think about often. Can someone help me better understand what happened?,"Maybe a moment of dissocation? You can look it up on wikipedia. Didnt happen to me but it was the first thing that came to mind. However, it only happened to you once right? And the psychologist doesnt seem worried about it? Perhaps you shouldnt either. The brain can do strange but often harmless things when your system is overheated."
111,BF exhibiting signs of mental illness/delusional disorder— don’t know what to do and feeling helpless,"Sounds like early stages of schizophrenia. Whether or not that's what the illness is, this article has some good advice on how to encourage someone to see a physician.

112,Just venting a bit.,"Your feelings are validated. Those grades dont mean shit, and there are plenty of successful people who didnt do well in school but succeeded anyway. Look up Gary Vaynerchuk on YouTube or Instagram. Hes inspiring and has a way to give you different perspective. He dropped out of school in fourth grade! Also Look up Jonice Webb (author of Running on Empty). You deserve a little space for your feelings. You dont need that kind of pressure. You're no disappointment, and for you to get on reddit and vent, is a huge step to figuring out how YOU feel. Listen to yourself, believe in yourself and know that whatever school grades you get, it does not define you. Dont let your parents make you feel like you let them down. It has nothing to do with them."
113,Emptiness and void due to ex gf,"Are you feeling numb because of her? Or have you always been feeling somewhat numb, only to feel alive when dating someone?"
114,How to tell my bf about my current mental health state?,"He seems a chill dude, you seem an intelligent person, sit down and talk to him.
I mean, I know that's not easy, but I think it's better than random/kinda silly things, like ""watch Melancholia with him"" (that's a movie supposed to build empathy with the realtives/SO about depression)

I'm sorry I can't help any better"
115,I’d rather see others happy then myself,"I can't give you any tips on how to deal with it but it's definitely something I'm struggling with too,"
116,My therapist told me there's no such thing as mental illness.,I can see her point of view but there are definitely people who grew up in loving secure homes who struggle from mental illness. I can see why her opinion would make you question if shes right for you. Express your concerns to her and don't feel bad if you need a new therapist
117,Any parents (preferably moms but all feedback’s appreciated) that can give me advice on how to approach my mom on the fact that I’m depressed and need a therapist?,"Not a mom but went through a similar situation with my mother back in high school. I ended up initiating the conversation by writing my mother a note and we discussed it more in person the next day. If you feel more comfortable having the conversation in a certain format (letters, texts, emails, over the phone) do it that way. 

Since my mother also has anxiety/depression she often tells me it feels like I'm blaming her for my problems or that she's failed as a mother when I try to talk to her about my problems so even if you do blame your parent(s) for the sake of the conversation tell them near the beginning that you aren't blaming them. 

Plan your conversation like you would a persuasive essay: what is your point/what is the goal of this conversation, what is your reasoning/why are you trying to achieve this goal, and why is this important. I advise keeping the conversation short because it's easy to wander off topic and that could result in ruffling feathers and not getting what you want (my mother is pretty anti-medication, anti-therapy so each time I would bring it up we got side tracked my point became weak, she thought she had persuaded me against therapy and medication whereas I still wanted to pursue it). You know your parents best so if you think it's necessary prepare some counter arguments, might also be worth it to prepare a list of things you *don't* want to result from the conversation (maybe you just want therapy and your parents will try to push medication, maybe they'll want you to take time off to recover, etc.).

As a side note have you checked to see what resources are available to you for free/cheap? We have a few walk-in counselling clinics near where I live, I know most grad schools offer reduced rates so that their students can complete their practicums, and my school offered free counselling services to all students. If you are anxious about telling your parents it probably would be best to discuss your anxieties with a professional first."
118,Age is just a number.,"You need to see value in yourself and what you do before you can actually accept the value other people see

119,"I'm not okay. I'm crying, Near midnight, hugging a pillow.","Take a step back, sign really deep and feel the hot, agitated air leave your body, and lay down flat on your bed. Turn off the music and breath slowly. As you breath in, feel the air run like water to the back of your lungs and as you breath out, feel the deepest pit of your feelings, the lead ball in your stomach, loosen. Focus only on breathing, deep and slow. Be calm and still. 

Once you regain that focus and fall asleep, wake up tomorrow and let us know how you're feeling. There are plenty of people on here, myself included, who would love to work through these things with you, but you have to calm down and rest first."
120,I'm being weighed down by my friends problems,"Sounds (hah) like you you take on your friends emotions and problems. They feel better for talking with you and you feel like a huge weight has been dumped on you. 
I don't know how to make it better but a therapist once told me to imagine a giant condom was over me or my friend...so you are there and can help but protected from the negative load- let me know if this works for you lol. 
It takes me a good 12 hours or so to start to feel better."
121,Am I an asshole for wanting to cut my mum out of my mental health treatment.,"Sounds like a logical conclusion if you would want to cut her out of it. Sometimes parents can make these things tough.

But depends on your age, govt laws etc, if you can do this.

I was dagonised almost a year ago, my parents still don't know I am on meds and therapy because they will only make things worse. But since I am 30 and living 2000 miles away...its easy."
122,Why do therapists expect you to do all the work on your own?,"Hate to be blunt but the work is 100% on you. A therapist is merely a non-bias 3rd party resource/guide to help nudge and educate you. 

If you’re going to therapy expecting them to do your hard work then you’ll have a hard time. A good therapist could see that you may have a hard time putting in the work to change or accept your life situations. 

You pay for a resource, not an easy fix."
123,Obsessive Thoughts,Have had the same thought process as you with certain things of my life that effect me everyday. I really wish I'd have gotten them figured out when I was younger because now I feel as if those thoughts are engraved in my mind
124,There's no where for me. I can't do this anymore,No body has given up on you even if you may feel that way it’s just your depression talking. If you want someone to talk to you can message me!
125,Just needing some outside prospective!,Just hang In there and be honest with your doctors. Don't go down the alcohol route it only makes people like us worse. If your going to do drugs do them safe. Sometimes a small dose of kratom like 2g will give me motivation in the morning if I feel too down just make sure that anything you do doesn't interfere with your medication.
126,"I really want to sing in a band, but my mental health is getting in the way, I feel like I'm too unstable","i'm not an artist but artists are human and i'm sure what you're feeling is normal. use the passion you have for music to overcome your fear. use it to express how you feel. i hope you overcome this fear and continue to do what you love 

side note: noticed you mentioned scream. what genre?"
127,What is wrong with me? How can I fix my issues?,You may be on the autism spectrum but I can't say for sure. Do you have trouble looking people in the eye. And physical exercise especially hitting a punching bag will help with your anger issues.
128,Experiencing something,"https://twitter.com/hellotiffy_/status/908851180884959238?s=21


There are good chat resources in this thread ^^^"
129,"Should I be looking for a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist?","Therapists and psychologists tend to do the same thing — talk therapy. (Psychologists can also do some clinical evaluations.) Psychoatrusts are mostly for medication management.

I think a therapist is the best place to start since once you find one you have rapport with, they will be your most regular “base camp” to meet with weekly. They can also refer you to a psychiatrist etc they have experience with.

Psychologytoday.com has the best searchable database with detailed profiles, imo. You can also sort by insurance. Good luck!"
130,"I wish I can shoot myself, but not just because I don’t want to live....",Try getting hammered. It usually helps me
131,How do you support a significant other?,"Marry him if you love him, even if he has depression. It can be a life-long battle to overcome so research depression and how to handle the highs and lows. Trust and security help alleviate it. Sometimes he may act out of character and you just have to let him be. Sometimes he needs you by his side and you just sit and wait and allow his moods to pass. We all know marriage won't fix it but it will reassure you both that your love is real and is what matters the most. You keep living your life and stay empowered and healthy and keep him grounded when you can."
132,Is there a way to sign myself up for therapy or something?,See your Dr/GP or go to hospital ER  for emergency assessment
133,I think I have Dependent Personality Disorder. My life is a nightmare.,Why aren’t you allowed to see a psychiatrist
134,How does it feel to have someone during your bad moments?,"Sometimes a hug or the presence of a person isn't nessasery, sometimes calling or messaging someone is just as helpful. Having someone to listen to what you're going through, it's almost therapeutic. I'm part of a discord server called speak up (PM me if you want an invite) And on one occasion in particular that I remember quite well, I was pretty much breaking down one night and I forced myself onto the chat to try and talk to someone. And someone responded. They talked to me, and comforted me, was patient even when I didn't seem to accept what they were saying half the time. They kept with me until I finally calmed down enough to fall asleep.

Needless to say, I'm extremely glad I found that discord, I don't know where I'd be without the comfort of those amazing people."
135,My OCs make me manically depressed. Does anyone else face that problem?,"I’ve never been manically depressed from my OCs but they have contributed to my depression. I talked to my dr. and switched brads which really helped. Oddly enough, they’ve actually helped my depression more than antidepressants have in the past"
136,Sometimes I feel like life is pointless,"Thank you for sharing your fears, it’s helping others to know they’re not alone.  Your view is not unique, my son son tells me the exact same thing.  He is 22 and was diagnosed with mental illness when he turned 18.  We realized there was something wrong when he dropped out of school his first semester of college and told us that we had him watched and that people were following him.  He’s been hospitalized several times since then, and now is pretty much home bound since he stopped taking meds.

So your belief in not wanting to to do anything cause you’re going to die is likely part of an illness that can be treated.  I’m very sad that my son is missing out on his 20’s, I have so many wonderful memories of being young and doing fun things like dancing, partying, traveling, living.

I hope you can get some help since while you’re not wrong - we’re all dying! - we’re here to experience life and do something that will make a difference to someone.  I’m 59 and today I took a dance class, drank a couple glasses of wine, enjoyed the sunshine, sent my sister money and cooked dinner for my family,  Life is good and hope you can accept some help to find your joy and purpose."
137,I am.....Everything but happy,"First of all, i just want you to know I hear you! You’ve got a lot weighing on you and it can all be too much sometimes. 

Chronic pain can really wear a person down quickly, I’m sorry but I don’t have many suggestions to help you there. Hopefully someone will respond with options for that. 

Is there any reason you need to stay at the job you hate? I would start looking for a similar paying position now, maybe you find something and maybe you don’t, but it helps to at least know what’s out there and remember you are not bound to this job forever!

As for your mental health, I’d really suggest going to see a therapist. Chronic pain has serious lifestyle, physical, and emotional tolls. A licensed therapist would be able to help you work through some of your concerns and see if medication might help you get back to your “normal” self. 

You have serious responsibilities, but the first one is always to yourself. You cannot take care of your wife and kids if you don’t take care of yourself first. I hope things look up soon, and I promise they will if you work at it ❤️❤️"
138,Punished for having good days,"www.dbtselfhelp.com  , try the emotional skills regulation part, good luck."
139,My best friends mental health is killing me....,"I’ve dealt with this same exact too many times and still do. My best friend is the same way yours is so I felt this 100%. It’s a shitty feeling because it’s hard to talk about this to others because even though it may sound “fucked up” or whatever to others, it isn’t at all. It’s great you’re an amazing person who’s always there for everybody but what about being there for yourself, you know? Constantly dealing with everybody else’s problems often forces you to shove all of your problems down, eventually feeling numb then eventually exploding. There’s this quote I really like that says “You can’t be everything for everybody”. Don’t feel bad for needing a break and wanting to not play therapist all of the time. It’s human nature and everybody needs a break. You sound like an amazing and caring person and that’s an amazing thing but you need to take some time for yourself. Whether it’s watching Netflix with face masks for a full day or doing a hobby you love (hiking, video games, whatever it may be). Everybody needs a break. Even though I’ve been going through this for years, it’s always extremely hard for me to tell the people who look at me for everything how I feel and I still struggle with that. I do the same thing you do, I reply less and less but don’t cut all communication off unless that’s something you truly want to do. Try to spend some time talking and hanging out with other friends or family members."
140,"You’re not a fucking manic pixie dream girl, and mania is not cute","Manic pixie dream girls describe characters in movies and books who are not well-written -- they aren't real people nor are they written as real people.  Maybe the delusional writer thinks they are, but they aren't.

The expression should be used to discuss a fictional trope.

It's not a trivialization of mental illness and does not describe mental illness.

""In 2005 film critic Nathan Rabin coined the term ""manic pixie dream girl."" Manic pixie dream girls were fictional characters who ""exist solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."""
141,Do you ever just cry over something really stupid? (Mini rant/story),"honestly, i’d be pissed too getting a grilled onion.
i cry over dumb shit too, you’re not alone 💕"
142,I think I might have bipolar,whens the last time you got a physical? blood work done? do you eat well? stay hydrated? hangriness is a real thing. you could also be lacking a vital nutrient on your body that's making your brain unbalanced.
143,Does this count as a panic attack?,"it sounds TERRIBLE, but not like a panic attack."
144,Courage,Nah courage is knowing you’re a gift to this world and living your life instead of ending it. Look up and see that you are here for a purpose. If anyone makes you feel like you’re life isn’t valuable then they aren’t worth your time.
145,Narcissistic parents impacted my mental health and I refused to open up to people,">And why am I just so scared of opening up to people sometimes?

Well, it's obvious, it's in the title of your post. If your primary caregivers are hard to talk to and be honest with, it can impact how you interact with others.  
If you are able to find a good counsellor or therapist, then hopefully they may be able to reverse some of the damage of your upbringing.

146,Criticisms of institutionalized Mental Health Care in America,"Content Warning: r?gendercritical may not be a safe place for everyone (i.e., trans, non-binary, etc.). Click through and engage at your own risk."
147,Help with insurance?,"Idk if you’re anywhere that Kaiser Permanente health insurance is available but I know you can do free sessions with a student counselor/therapist through them. I believe that’s available whether you have insurance with them or not. And honestly I had more luck with the students than licensed therapists, feels like they actually care and want to help. 

I will say kaisers behavioral health department leaves a lot to be desired but free is free. Kaiser is the only one I know of cause it’s the only one I used, but I’m sure there’s similar programs available. 

As far as actual insurance I’m afraid I can’t offer much help there"
148,A question about technology and mental health,I’ve FaceTime’d with my doctor and it seemed fine. Brief but nothing beats going to the office. I figured when you’re in a pinch it will do but if you have the time  go to the office.
149,I’ve been dumping all of my issues onto my boyfriend and I messed up.,"That's not the right way to think about it, you just...did a bit much all in once. If you would have spread it all on three or four separate conversations that he probably wouldn't have been overwhelmed.
But nobody will blame you for what you did or how you did it"
150,Those days where you're completely exhausted at the end because you've spent the entire day fighting your mental illness with everything you have,Yep I can relate. You can make it through! You’re amazing and strong.
151,Tips of staying clean from self harm?,"I guess you have not had a mental health assessment? , do you feel empty inside ? and try to solve it and intense almost unbearable emotional pain with self harm ? Does it ‘ ground ‘ you , sorry to sound like an TV advert and don’t mean to be intrusive. You don’t  have to reply if this’s too much."
152,I wish I was brave enough to kill myself,"I used to get this feeling a lot, still do from time to time. What has helped me is just accepting that I'm not ""brave"" enough to kill myself, so I should put that fact to good use and start putting my life back together. I had all this energy that went into thinking of ways to kill myself, so I decided to use that energy to find ways to make my life better. 

It sounds really simplistic and easy when I say it like that, and I don't mean to invalidate your struggle, or my own. Fully accepting that decision actually took me about two years. In the interim, every time I wanted to kill myself I tried to remind myself that the mental energy was better spent elsewhere. I kept my mind occupied with other things as much as possible, took a drawing class, tried to be more physically active (can't do gyms lol but I do my best), and generally tried to make my life better. 

This helped me more than anything else. I needed a lot of help from friends too. My best friend suggested the drawing class. I only did it because it was a free class offered by my local library, but I loved it and I still draw to this day 3 years later! Find someone in your life who cares about you, tell them your feelings, and ask them to help you commit to making a better life for yourself. Little things add up! I still struggle with suicidal thoughts on occasion, but now I can deal with them much more easily by saying, ""I've put all this effort into making things better, it would be a shame to waste that.""

Again, I know that might sound impossible or out of reach from where you're at now. But I was where you're at 3 years ago and I'm doing so much better now. I know it's possible for you too ❤️ I wish you the best and hope you find healing and happiness."
153,I need some support and advice. I have a verbally abusive parent.,Is there someone at school you can talk to? A counselor or a teacher?
154,Scared to share my mental illness because why would anyone want to deal with this?,"If he loves you, he will love you flaws and all. What makes you think you need to throw all this out there four months into your relationship if it hasn’t come up thus far?"
155,Self help books before therapy?,"No, I’m a mental health counselor and think it’s great when clients come in with some insight. If you read self help books and find skills/strategies you’d like to try and tell your therapist. You are in charge of your therapy. We’re just there to help."
156,I can’t sleep: manic?,Benadryl yourself up if you dont have anything stronger.
157,I have no idea what's wrong with me,Please see a psychiatrist. This is slightly out of reddit's pay grade.
158,Mental health can be bizarre,"Mental health is bizarre and can definitely kick in suddenly. Sorry to hear you’ve been going through a lot lately! 

I know what I’m about to say may come off rude, and I’m not saying it’s right, but a lot of times doctors tend to brush things off if they feel like you’re exaggerating. I’m not saying you are in terms of the pain you feel but in terms of weight loss and CPR, it seems like a stretch.

20kg=44lbs=158,400 calories total = 11,314 calories per day deficit. You’d have to be eating nothing and working out like Michael Phelps everyday to lose that much in 2 weeks."
159,OCD had destroyed my mind and robbed me of my life.,"Same thing, I don't know who I'm anymore. 
Seen a therapist?  Like someone to help process our mind thoughts. It's a tough battle. I have ocd similiar to you."
160,Slowly giving up on life right now,"I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling so much. Try reaching out for professional help. It isn't easy, but you'd feel different even after a couple of sessions. A good psychologist or therapist will create a safe space in your mind where you'll learn to feel compassionate and kind towards yourself and slowly gather strength to cope with your life (and, perhaps, even enjoy it at some point)."
161,Last shift before 4week off and im going to explode.,"Just for record my job related psychiatrist pushed me to find someone ""professional"" after i told whats the problem. I can handle it. I wish someone would just punch me and torture me like my dad did over 15y. I would feel loved again."
162,Quick headsup about alcohol and social anxiety.,"yup, it's really important to know and be clear about your limit, otherwise you could find yourself in embarrasing or just plain dangerous situations."
163,I don't understand what I'm experiencing,"I’ve never had this but maybe something similar. I would imagine a horse galloping but the horse couldn’t keep galloping, it would roll or something like that. And it was incredibly annoying. I couldn’t control it. 
There are a lot of people who have objects in their mind that they can’t control like spinning objects or flying objects, so that’s normal. 
What’s not normal is being so affixed on them, where they make you feel anxious. The difference with people who have anxiety and don’t have anxiety is being able to separate your thoughts from your emotions. 
What might help you is pulling up a video of this object and see that it doesn’t do what you’re thinking. 
What you have is some kind of anxiety or OCD with intrusive thoughts but of course I can’t give you a diagnoses as I’m not a doctor. And while these intrusive thoughts may not be disturbing, they still make you feel uneasy."
164,Adderall making me angry and irritable?,"Talk to your doc about a possible dose increase, or changing to a sustained release version of Adderall. Your weight is higher than it was when you took it before, so your old dose may not be as effective as it was in the past. 

Also, body and brain chemistry changes as you age. Sometimes the drugs need to be changed up as well. Keep trying! :)"
165,I have a newfound mental problem and idk what to do about it😕,"Not trying to invidate you, but you can claim to have as many conditions as you want; it's meaningless until you have a diagnosis. 

You really want help? Go see a psychologist. Your doctor should be able to refer you."
166,"don’t relate to this much, just wanted to share","It is actually really tough to go through, especially since they can unintentionally say some pretty hurtful stuff. It's a pretty big commitment honestly."
167,Does exercise help?,It helps but doesn't cure it. It's so hard for me to motivate myself to do those things though.
168,I wish I had an idea on how to be myself,"Love it !  


But can't you deal with some sweet kind words. I believe it's the start of a beautiful thing. You're so lucky ! Make the most out of it and tell him about what you feel about him that will set both of you free and it will ignition a beautiful path in both of your lifes. 

&#x200B;

You're trying to be ""à la hauteur"" and to give a good impression. There is nothing you would want to sabotage yourself about. It's just you and it's maybe you react in a different way because you get really affected by such kind words. You might be the kind of people that request a lot of things from themselves in order to be meeting high levels of performance. It's good but be cautious of what you require from yourself.

&#x200B;

Trust me you don't have any problem :D You're amazing to make someone fall in love with you. You should be proud !!"
169,Binge drinking on medication?,"Yes, don’t do this and listen to your doctor."
170,Struggling,Is there possibly some sort of free health clinic in your area? You could also look up sliding scale doctors who will accept a lower payment based on your income. If you do end up getting to a doc just tell them you don’t have insurance and you need the cheapest antidepressant possible. There is an app on iPhone and probably android called amwell where you can visit with a doctor for about $50 without insurance. They can call in a prescription to your local pharmacy. - insurance agent / fellow depressed guy. Hope that helps.
171,A woman on the national suicide hotline insulted me and argued with me.,"Unfortunately, many people that work in these call centers are hardly professionals but volunteers. You got the shitty luck of the draw, and probably nabbed a woman with already some base level hatred of men, and she saw you as an easy target.

Sydney is a failure liberal arts major who is an inept volunteer with little experience and even less sense, I wouldn't think too much about it. Your strength, however, is admirable.

&#x200B;

For someone so toxic to work in mental health shows a glaring lack of self awareness, and she probably isn't too high in the IQ department."
172,I run a mental health support Discord server.,joined you
173,My mentall health is getting in the way of me being physically better looking,"Have you thought about looking into invisalign? In some cases it costs the same as traditional braces. I have invisalign right now and it’s not easy at first, but worth it."
174,How many people here have parents who are imdifferent to suicide?,Mine. Before I cut my dad out of my life he told me my depression was “fake” and that I was wrong. My mom just doesn’t understand mental illness like most people. So that’s annoying in itself
175,Do I owe it to him to tell him?,"I'd tell him. For many reasons. It gives him information on how to support you, it gives you peace of mind, and besides, do *you* want to find out some other way that he doesn't support people with mental illnesses? That's something I'd want to know up front."
176,"I was hurt, and I hurt my world.","You accept that not every relationship is meant to be and work on yourself.
Sometimes, two good people get together and are toxic together, even if they have good intentions. Learn from it, grow, and be the person you want to be. The next time you end up with someone, you’ll be in a better place."
177,Best way to clear my mind,"My psych doc explained to me that part of anxiety is physiological. You breath faster and shallower which gives you less oxygen to work with so then you feel worse.
He suggested we work on breathing techniques. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7, breathe out for 8.
His advice was for moderate anxiety, so maybe that’s not very helpful, but i hope its a starting place."
178,Do normal people actually talk to others about how they feel?,"People often talk about how they feel. Typically to close friends and family, Not everybody is equipped to handle other people’s emotions though so tread lightly. I found journaling very helpful and I just wrote out everything I felt, it let me clear my mind a bit and figure out the whys and hows."
179,I don't know if I love my dad?,I often feel the same way about my dad and have a similar situation. It’s hard. I love him but I hate him and resent him. It’s kinda a personal choice and an ongoing inner struggle from what I see in myself and my friends with similar situations (why are so many dads so shitty!?) I think at the end of the day it comes down to what type of relationship you want to have with him and what needs to be forgiven/forgotten or held accountable and made right for that relationship to work for you. Don’t let societies expectations bully you into accepting less than you deserve.
180,My birthday is the most lonely day of the year,"I feel ya. I turned 31 this year, and my birthdays have always been notoriously shitty. One year my brother got stabbed over bath salts and almost died. Last year the area my boyfriend lives in had a massive flood and they had to evacuate. Huge sink holes formed and everything.  I live in that area now, and they are still fixing damage from that flood. This year my license got suspended over a 25 dollar fix it ticket that I took care of, but somehow got lost in the system.  

Birthdays are just a mark of making another revolution around the sun. Congratulations on surviving another revolution.  Lets hang around to find out what humourously shitty thing can happen to us next year. 

Happy birthday."
181,I just need I tell someone,"That’s amazing I’m so proud of you!! As someone with pstd/has been assaulted and can be triggered by certain people, going a place they are is a huge step. You overcame part of you fear of him and didn’t let him cause you to not have fun. I hope you continue to heal :)"
182,How do I (19F) tell someone(22M) I can't date them right now because of my mental health?,"You sound like one of those people who has difficulty saying no.

And he sounds pretty weird. Inappropriate even.

You don't need to disclose your mental health. Tell him that you've changed your mind about the date. He'll ask why. Tell him that you don't want to talk about it. He'll insist on a reason. Keep responding with ""I don't want to talk about it."" Maybe have one of your friends present when you do it."
183,How to deal with unsupportive family,Can I ask why your husband doesn’t know about your BPD?
184,I feel like maybe I don't really belong anywhere anymore.,"I'm having a similar problem, but with irl friends. Its hard to explain but they don't seem upset when I can't hang out anymore for whatever reason. It's like they plan something during my work hours, so I say I can't make it, and there's no acknowledgement. Idk, just makes me wanna sit around and not do anything anyway."
185,Fear of being tracked down?,"Ah the irrational thought process. Paranoia is a major part of irrational thoughts. At the time its completely and utterly possible (in your head) that this would happen but after the episode you can rationalize it and realise it won't, am I right? Perhaps time to speak to your dr who will no doubt pass you onto some form of talking therapy but your not alone you just need to retrain your brain to be calmer when you have these irrational thoughts and know that it will pass and it isn't real. Easier said than done at times but it can be."
186,I’ve been currently to scared to go to sleep,It seems like you have a natural affinity to these things and most likely your sporadic appearances will continue to occur.

192,Extreme Struggles w/ Food Relationship...,I’m not gonna give you a lecture about why you should get therapy and why this isn’t healthy cuz you absolutely clearly know that. What I will say is this. I’ve been there. I know the pain. And one day you will slowly loosen the grip that food has on you and asbit slowly releases you you will ease into being your happier healthier more true self. You will look better. You will feel better. You will be better off in every way. And you will get there. It will be hard and it will take time but you will get there. Cut yourself slack. Love yourself. And breathe.

194,"I [16, NB] feel... hollow.","Don't compare yourself to others. Just because some of your friends are better at something doesn't mean that you are bad at it.

195,Psychosis or just teenage paranoia?,"No experience with weed, but I have these thoughts quite a lot. I feel like my parents, or anyone around me could snap at me at any moment, because when people get upset at me I have a hard time knowing why. Is it similar, maybe? do you have trouble picking up on social cues? because that in itself can cause paranoid thoughts."
196,Please.,"It's ok.

You're ok.

I'll fight for you."
197,I don’t know how to feel anymore,Hey. Don’t suck it up. Keeping everything in always builds up and it never ends out in a good situation. It’s like trying to fill a cup with more and more water but you’re running out of room. Maybe try talking to your friends more and genuinely tell them how you feel. Maybe they’ll understand eventually. Cheer up just blow some bubbles and keep pushing because it’ll turn up eventually. You just gotta keep swimming
198,I need a place to vent. Everything's falling apart.,"Hey, same to almost all of this, even just made my account tonight... *For the sake of posting on this sub.* We could chat more if you want to do just a thread of replies, or take it to DMs, no pressure on either front, though.  Anyways, I promise it gets better. I think. I kinda had an upswing from a similar situation recently, though my negativity hasn't gone away even though my situation is much better than it was.

I'd like to say though, as cliche as it sounds, the best thing is to just tough it out. It's hard to do, I know, but it's the only way to improve your situation. Don't denounce your current friends, but try making new ones if you feel like you aren't being treated well. Personally, while i wouldn't condone this since it's pretty extreme, the only thing that helped me was cutting my old friends off completely. About the discord, though, is it possible you could use the browser version on incognito? or do your parents check up on you too often for that to be possible?"
199,Need advice,"You can go to the doctor and pay cash, but if you use your dad’s insurance, the insurance company sends a form showing the doctor visits to his house.

200,Quote I found about self sabotage,"I do that some days, it really does hurt me. I purposefully missed volunteering by going to bed at a stupidly late hour and oversleeping. I really wanted to go but I guess part of me didn't."
201,Why does no one find me attractive?,"Do you have close friendships? They can do wonders for building self confidence.

Sorry if I'm being a bit presumptuous, and I don't really know much about dating either, but I've never heard the idea of ""you're not my type"" equating to someone not being attractive enough. I know a couple of people who have a similar mindset to this, and it's hard to help, mostly because i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings more than they already are. Just know nobody's unlovable, but sometimes it takes a different approach to be with someone. All of my relationships, though few, have developed from long time friendships that just kinda naturally developed that way. Dating for the sake of dating, both in my case and the case of people i know, has almost always ended up either with rejection, or been a trainwreck of a toxic relationship. just... make friends! Find people you can really be yourself around, whose company you enjoy, and who enjoy yours."
202,Suicidal thoughts are creeping in,"It may feel like it now, but I can assure you that it was not your fault.

you're so strong for reaching out on here for help, but I'd also recommend you try and find a therapist asap to help you get through this. (yes, you can get through this - I believe in you)

207,"Need advice, I feel like I messed up my first psychiatrist visit","I have the same problem. Always terrible psych appts due to talking and honesty issues on my part. So ive started journaling, and then i just print out what ive written and give it to him. Because that way i cant lie. When journaling, im not writing for an audience, but just for me. So im 100% honest with myself. I recommend doing this. Its helped me greatly."
208,My mother is a hoarder and refuses help,"Wow, just wow. I have been looking around for a good few months even close to a year about a situation that is close to mine, and this is it. FINALLY!

&#x200B;

a little back story of me,  my mom and dad are still together after 40 years and they deny deny deny that they are hoarders, they have a 2100 sqft house that they live out of 400 sqft of it bc of all the crap that they have a need for. The have 1 cat who is trained and goes in the litter box, but there house just smells of stale/moldy/mildew air . to the point that when you get a gift from them and it doesn't even matter where they keep it, even in their car , u can smell that stench on anything they give you, even the wrapping paper of the gift.

It's to the point that it has been about 5 years since I have been inside the house that I grew up in, granted i'm 34 now and no one besides my parents have lived there for about 13 years, its still heartbreaking that I can't take my 3 kids to the house I grew up in and show them some of my memories of the house or yard bc of this smell. Not only myself but my sister has also offered to come to the house during 1 week, get a dumpster and help them throw away/clean things up. but every time this comes up we get the mixed feelings, at first they say well we just need you kids (3 of us) to come and get your stuff you want that you left behind (again 13 years since i left, about 15 for my sister, and about 20 for my brother, and I'm the only local one) but the last time my brother was around he got yelled at for taking this train set that he played w as a kid, and they wouldn't let it go. So we don't know which it is you want us to get stuff but then yell when we do ?!?!?!?

&#x200B;

My wife has always been on my case to throw things away and I have noticed over the years I tend to keep less and less myself, I can defiantly see some of them in me with the hoarding, but with my wife's help, I have managed to keep it very simple and it makes for a lot easier of things.

&#x200B;

This goes deeper with my parents that as close as they live to me (within 20 miles) they rarely come to visit and we rarely see them, and again its sad bc I want them to be part of my kids lives but they just don't seem to have an interest in it.

&#x200B;

I could just keep going on about them, but I honestly don't know what to do about the hoarding aspect of this either, I remember I used to find bank statements of my parents old bank accounts that were closed bc the bank has since been bought out, like talking about 10+ years , and I would just rip them up and throw them away, but why, why are we holding onto all this old stuff that some can just be visited to online, and a lot of the clutter is just old stuff that has no meaning (at least to me) anymore, and like I said before everything has this smell to it so anything that someone might want , they won;t want anymore.

&#x200B;

It scares me to know that one day M&D won't be around anymore, and who's going to have to clean it all up ...... me , so besides telling them I will help, I am lost, do we go to some type of Dr for this, kinda like the TV show hoarders? If you or anyone else has info on this I would love to hear it."

210,Is it okay to seek a relationship to improve one’s mental health?,"I think its normal if you aren't seeking to make your problems your SO's, if you feel more energized when around them that means they make you happy. I'm glad you found something to make you feel good! It becomes unhealthy if you use them to make you feel happy and spill problems onto. Keep things in perspective and be proud you found someone who makes you feel alive :D

But I would try not to call it ""improving your mental health"" dont label it like that. Just say you're having fun, you're feeling good. Make it more positive :D"
211,Weird,It depends on how long this has been going on I think.

215,Losing track of time.,"It’s shock

The brain’s self defense mode

I’m going through one now- instead of acting on intense suicidal  depression my brain has slipped into shock mode

Nothing is real. If I remember some of the things that triggered this episode the thought is like a scene from a movie

Staying in bed is safer for me- so I’ll do that. I have to be somewhere tomorrow and to go to work on Monday. Not sure when/if it will pass. 

Reddit is a life line during these episodes."
216,DAE cling to one person?,"I experience the same thing... 

I have actually once or twice before become completely co-dependent on my partner which wasn't good for either of us (especially when the relationship came to an end) . 

I think you're okay though; you are able to look after yourself but you're also fortunate to have someone who can make you feel so safe and comforted :))"
217,Going through a rough time mentally and I keep lashing out emotionally.,"Major props that you understand that you may be lashing out at your fiancée, I'm sorry for what you're going through and with these things there are no quick solutions. You could step back and write down the things that you appreciate and love in your life right now, and focus on them to gain some form of happiness or satisfaction. Your fiancée will understand and help you get through this, hope this helped :)"
218,Remembering who you were before trauma.,"When i was a kid i used to be more outgoing and liked being outside but there was a time where my friend had a birthday party and i wanted to join, y'know being a good friend but my dad didnt want me to.  I didnt want to disappoint my friend so i tried to get out of my house but my dad got really violent and choked me almost to death. He did that because i didnt obey him and ever since then im too scared to go outside and have social anxiety and every time i go out i dissociate.

There were also a lot of incidents where my dad gets violent and all of them contributed to my current shitty depression state.  Im 12 years younger than you and i dont know what good advice i could give and dont know if it can help but  being unable to reconnect the old you doesnt mean you are broken.  You dont need to be the same person as you were before to be 'fixed'.  Borrowing from my therapist's words,  we should focus on the present not the past nor the future because we can think what we could do right now.  The you right now is still you. Lets both do our best to move on from our traumas even if it takes so long."
219,I feel like I always need to prove myself,"Sorry to hear your struggles. You are not alone, I have suffered the same, I’m 50 now and a few weeks back I tried to top myself, I had enough of being unable to please people and not being listened to. I survived and was admitted to stress therapy. They teach you to challenge your default behaviour. It’s difficult to grasp at first, but basically you need to avoid your emotions taking over your life. So next time someone tells you are told you are useless, rather than get stressed about it later, STOP.  Take a deep breath, and LET GO. Observe what were you thinking? What are you feeling? Now tell yourself you are good looking sexy and in control. Tell yourself it’s only words, they don’t know you ONLY you know yourself and you have a great life ahead of you, you will achieve a lot. You have no time for gossip. They are small people with small minds talking about small insignificant matters. You on the other hand are better than that. Rise above it. Listen to music you enjoy, browse the net and look at beaches, etc. Good luck!"
220,I feel that mental disorders or any kind of mental struggles are being romanticised or used as a form of marketing lately,Agreed. I think too many are jumping on a bandwagon now and claiming they have a mental illness over the smallest things
221,Just need a bit of help with something relating to thoughts of reality and death,i know what youre talking about i think about that too sometimes when i start thinking like that i try and think of the positive like how life is what you make of it
222,i wish i had the courage,"I wish could say something totally motivational, but I'm out of words. The only thing that is keep me alive is that I don't want my family to have a bad  memory. But maybe there's something beautiful in this world, like ice cream, those good movies or some nice places, there's many things that I want to do before say goodbye and I know that you have one.  Maybe you want to visit a country, eat a expensive food, do something totally stupid but funny. Let's search something to live for. 
(Sorry if you don't get what I say, I don't speak English)"
223,I think I kinda hate myself,"I've struggled with alot of things that you have, like with the anxiety where you can't talk infront a bunch of people, and how it makes you feel like your friends hate you. I have a fairly curvy figure that at times I feel insecure about as I feel/look fat. I've just turned 18 and I'm thankfully out of school, as the high school I attended was absolutely horrible to me. I was depressed majorly and every day was a huge struggle. 

My anxiety used to be the worst thing in my life, I never spoke to anybody at all when I was younger, if someone spoke to me I'd freeze and have a panic attack because I didn't have an idea on how to respond. It's something that you have to conquer, it never goes away as I still get major anxiety, but I'm stronger and I can control it better. I'm not so afraid of speaking to people now. 

Alot of the issues you're facing I understand isn't easy, I personally think what you should do is:

Talk to someone you trust about how you feel, about your mental health. Is there anything stressing you out? Is there anything you're worried about? Is there anything you wish to be different? 

Try to keep yourself busy, as you mentioned talking to a group is frightening, perhaps get involved in hobbies like books? Or movies & TV shows. 

For your anxiety, I know that it's not easy at all to overcome it. Try to face some situations that cause you to feel anxious, not talking to massive groups of people, that's throwing you in the deep, deep end. But instead try building your confidence by engaging people in conversation, learn about what they like. 

I hope non of this comes across as patronising, I know that dealing with depression, anxiety etc, isn't easy at all. It's tough overcoming stuff like this."
224,Am I a horrible person because of horrible thoughts?,Thoughts aren't bad. Actions are.
225,Whats wrong with me.,"I am by no means a professional but you could maybe have a little look into some dissociative disorders (there's a lot) and see if you feel any of them explain some of the things you're feeling? try not to get too tangled up in obsessively researching, but maybe just have a little look. 

I'm here if you ever need to talk

227,Can writing down what i remember help improve my long term memory if my forgetfulness is most likely caused by some type of trauma,"Similar issues. Memory problems too. My room littered with post it's everywhere, with small to big reminders ranging from things for tomorrow, next week or end of/next month. I also keep a journal at home and small note pad to carry with me when I'm out. It's helped a lot, my memory isn't getting better but at least I'm able to remind myself of things so when I forget it isn't damaging."
228,What's wrong with me?,"You are a doormat and they don’t respect you- they take you for granted and don’t trust you because you’re too nice and care too much. You’ll forgive so they get worse- enabling them to hurt you and use you. 

You are too good. Too kind. 

They don’t deserve you."
229,Overwhelmed,Ooooo man this hit me. Question before anything do you see a psych or take meds?

236,can being told that no one likes you as a kid make you less likeable as an adult?,"##### Not a doctor & I’m pulling my opinion from personal experience 

Childhood PTSD because of fam
> when i was a kid my dad would relentlessly bash me for being annoying. 
>> all the kids at my own birthday party are excluding me? well who's fault is that, but mine for being the most annoying and unlikable kid ever.

>  had no friends, and i never really had an answer for that question. but you can bet my dad sure did. stop being so fucking annoying! thanks for the advice dad!

No it’s the PTSD talking & because of the mental abuse at home you’re having hints of schizoeffective: this makes you believe what you’re thinking 
> I think that this mental baggage has really prevented me from having any sort of courage to talk to my peers. It's made me so insecure about myself that ive always gone into social interactions with the expectation that the people i am being introduced to will or already do find me annoying or unlikable. and i was wondering if maybe the fact that i already think people find me annoying, can actually make me an unlikable person.

Social anxiety because of the traumatic home environment 
> i was never able to make any friendships in elementary school

> in elementary school, i never talked to anyone, never partnered up with classmates for group activities - i always said that i ""preferred to work alone"", even though i was actually just too shy to talk to other kids. I would hide in the alleyways between classroom buildings during recess.

I think you should at least try to gaining some insight & talk to someone. You can try a nonprofit I know that helps worldwide with finding someone/low cost & if you cannot afford to pay, they will cover it. [https://www.youarerad.org/](https://www.youarerad.org/)

EDIT: to answer your question. It doesn’t. There is some things you might need to work on to improve confidence but till then you need to come to a closer & letting go of the past before you can shine at your best."
237,I don’t know what’s wrong with me.,Hey man i am sorry you are feeling this way i feel you i am there right now but sometimes you will get feelings of loneliness and sadness but just keep pushing through you will make it man
238,"He has ended a 5 months relationship because of some mental health issues,how long before I can text him to ask how he is doing?",You can message him any time you want. There’s a likelihood that there’s someone else.
239,"M35, depressed about regrets of the past. Tips on how to solve these?","At 35, you are still young. The past is gone, there is nothing that you can do to change that, so try to let it go (not easy I know). **The here and now is what's most important**. The future can be dealt with some other day.  At 12 years old, I had a big speech impediment spent many hours with speech therapist, yet 20 years later I was a DJ on a radio station. You can overcome your fears. Here's a tip, when you get a negative thought or you feel a failure, STOP, don't go any further. Take 10 minutes then think again, spend those 10 minutes looking at pictures of beautiful beaches across the world, better still, music is a great therapy. When I get down, I'll put Ace of Spades or Pretty Fly for a White Guy on my phone and I feel better. If I get negative thoughts about past events, I've learnt to imagine the people who have hurt me as stupid clowns, falling over each other and making funny farting noises, and I laugh about it. 

Good luck, your not alone in the world, and as the saying goes, a problem shared is a problem halved. We may not be able to wave that magic wand, but talking is a good therapy. Keeping things bottled up and never releasing it will eventually eat you. I had 40 years of it, and while I was good at hiding it, eventually it was a case of what the mind conceals, the heart reveals after all. 

&#x200B;

Take care"
240,While responding to an active shooter recently; I had to draw my weapon out. Is it normal to still have thoughts of the event?,"Sounds normal to me. In fact, I'd be very concerned if a moment like that didn't have an emotional impact."
241,Is presumptuous advice helpful?,"I am kind of on board with what you are getting at.  Even though my family are deeply self involved people that don't really make an effort to know or understand me they would be devastated if I died, but like do they 'need' me? Need is a term for dependents and I do not have any.  Also, coming from a family of personality disorders the 'you are loved' advice is presumptuous bullshit.  Many people are quite factually not loved because their family does not understand how to feel or express actual healthy love.  The positivists are often blinded to their own privilege and narrow view.  I think a more honest and universal statement is 'you are worthy of love' which is true of everyone and doesn't imply the person seeking support is just oblivious to being surrounded by love and support.  It may be true that some people experience warped perspective and overlook sources of support, but many others are in crisis because they lack healthy relationships by default."
242,The government is denying me therapy,What was the reason you were denied therapy
243,What's the most number of days you took off for a mental health break?,"I'm just a uni student so it's not really comparable but still I've taken a leave of absence for a whole semester to ""recover"" from depression and OCD. Honestly my pessimistic and nihilistic mindset hasn't gone and I'll probably live with it for the rest of my live. I don't even know if it's the real diagnosis or the psychiatrist just wanted me to feel okay without being labelled with multiple mental disorders. Sorry I'm not really giving any advice except like ranting. I'm also interested in knowing how others are doing to combat mental ""illnesses."" Sorry."
244,I just dont know what I did wrong,"As someone who has been through so many break ups with friends, I can tell you a lot of things. Sometimes, people just leave you because they feel like it. And that is not your fault. People depart from others, because they can and they know it and they want to. People who find interest in you, who love you and respect you and want you in their life will hold onto you and actively try to talk to you. I can tell you right now that the people who don’t do that don’t deserve you. You will ultimately move on from that person, it just takes time. There are so many people in this world who would put more effort into talking to you than that one person, and you haven’t met any of them yet."
245,I don’t think I’m depressed but I don’t think I’m ok either.,You're depressed.
246,Why do I feel like this,"Why did you begin doing all those things? Because other people said they were normal? 

Are your friends true friends?

What do you ACTUALLY want to do?"
247,Advice/help please,"It sounds like a lot of the pressure you are feeling stems from being the only staff member on site and not having authority to make decisions. Is there an action plan for what you should do in case of an emergency? Does it seem reasonable - are there examples given (or that you can think of) where it would work? Talk with your supervisor about it if you feel like you are encountering (or likely to encounter) situations not covered in the plan. Maybe things could be added or modified that would improve your confidence in the plan - for example, maybe the sleepless patient could be allowed to use a different area to walk which wouldn't generate as much noise to wake others. 

It also sounds like your lack of sleep isn't doing you any favors right now. Is that something you can resolve with your full time job schedule - setting things up so that you have time for naps on days when you will be working nights? If you need a certain number of hours in this job for grad school eligibility then keeping it for now may seem inevitable, which also puts pressure on you. There are other jobs out there that could get you the same experience - don't stay in a situation where you don't feel safe just because it is part of the requirements for your career plan."
248,"There is something deeply wrong with me, what should I do about it?",Sounds like you need to be honest about what’s going on. How can your therapist help you when he/she doesn’t have all the right information?
249,"I was a stoner for 10 years until I reached complete rock bottom, was diagnosed with schizophrenia, manic depression and bipolar. Now that I don’t smoke. I’m back to my real self.","good for you man, cannabis isnt for everyone, I think a lot of people forget how wildly different it can affect different people."
250,Second opinion on medication,"Hello, I’m sorry about all the shit that went down. Unfortunately, no one here on Reddit can help you with a second opinion about your treatment. None of us here are doctors, and if someone is a doctor, he/she will not be able to make a decision based on your Internet post. 

Please do not trust strangers on the Internet with your health, it is too important to take risks like that. The only way for you to get a second opinion is to see a different doctor in real life, where you can explain your situation during an appointment and evaluate the options that you have. 

I’m sorry that we can’t help you here, but I hope our comments can give you courage to seek treatment alternatives with real health professionals in real life. Hang in there.

ETA: Just wanted to add that it’s normal to feel weird when you first start psychiatric medications. Don’t worry though, most medications are not addictive if taken as prescribed, and you will need to wait at least a couple of weeks for the side effects to go away and the treatment effects to start. It honestly sounds to me like you could even just talk to your current psychiatrist about your medication worries, and they should be able to explain to you what to expect. Taking meds is not easy, but you will be okay in the end."
251,How do I stop treating life like one big goal post?,"People innately feel the need to be or act as the best themself they can (sorry if that’s phrased weirdly). I know it’s hard to let go out that tension, but you have to take time and practice in helping yourself. Take a break from your actions. Think to yourself, what would change if I did that? What wouldn’t change? It’s not the end of the world to stop doing something you genuinely don’t feel like doing. You have to practice that type of resistance. It takes a huge toll on your self-esteem otherwise. The harsh and cruel truth can sometimes be that people genuinely don’t pay that much attention to the things that you fixate heavily on. Being a perfectionist doesn’t attract more people to become your friends. People genuinely like others who they can relate to. Don’t be so hard on yourself and take it a step at a time - no one is perfect and you don’t have to try to be."
252,I keep having what seems to be mild hallucinations. What can I do?,"This sounds like nightmares/night terror and anxiety, not hallucinations"
253,Where can I go for real mental issues?,Counseling helps a lot
254,I can't think and I'm thinking too much,"I’m no professional and I’m not you so take this with some salt. 

It sounds like a lot of stress built up from something you don’t have control over. My most relevant story I can’t share so ill try the second best. 

When I was in college, I couldn’t pay for it, couldn’t get a job, girlfriend wouldn’t love me anymore, etc. tons of stress. I’m doing all I can but there’s so much I can’t touch and whenever I’m not super busy the “thinking too much but can’t think at all” thing happens. And it’s life ruining. I didn’t have a sex drive, but I was filled with rage even more than usual. 

When you find what it is, or even if you don’t find the stressor, taking up smaller hobbies, getting rid of useless negative hobbies, and taking steps, even the smallest of steps, to progress in the right direction to tackling any issue of yours (because chances are the big issue can’t be touched) helps. 

This is pretty long winded and probably didn’t make the impression I was hoping for, but you’re not alone. There are things we can’t always budge but there are certainly things we can!"
255,Any child experts here?,"Nobody is going to be able to tell you whether the right approach is being taken here or not. It would be on the unethical side of things since we don't know what kind of therapy he is receiving, what his treatment plan actually consists of, what is being targeted during therapy, etc. I can understand your concern for the kiddo. But, all you can really do is voice your opinion, and ask if research-based practices are being used....and then do your best to let the kiddo know that you love and care about him."
256,How do I get through this?,[deleted]
257,Hello I’ve tried to talk about this with my friends but they don’t seem to understand I’ve told my doctor once and she prescribed me medication It didn’t help,"Sorry , but TBD .??"
258,I just realized I don't really care about myself/my own opinions. Is this common?,"You put this into words very well. I couldn’t have ever found a way to describe this. I am not good with words. 
I know what you mean and am that way. I’m still working at it so this is not a cure, but what I’ve worked on. 
I set limits for myself, there are rules which control whether or not I say yes. There are rules on which things I should be stubborn on. Not rules per se, but guidelines sort of. As I’ve followed these I’ve found myself able to do what I want before having t think about what the other person is saying. I also feel like I don’t have an opinion, but once you are used to saying no, and holding your ground, you know your answer before you actually do. 

This sounds terrible, but I really hope it made sense, and helps in the slightest."
259,How do you break up with someone who threatens suicide?,"Break up with them. Try to contact the family to let them know what’s going on, so they can try to help them, but ultimately your friends life comes first. Your friend needs to not lose her life for someone else’s. 

My sister just finished up her divorce, and BIL threatened suicide the whole time, and I sleep with a shotgun because he threatened to kill us all, but we contacted his family first when this all started, and they’ve done what they could. He was arrested last night, driven off all of his family and friends. 

This story sounds scary, but the breakup won’t kill someone. The breakup won’t make someone crazy. The breakup won’t hurt someone. That person was already broken, and they could hurt your friends life too if she doesn’t get out the relationship. It’s in her best interests, and whatever happens to the ex is not her fault or her doing."
260,I need to get over my hate.,"I have anger issues too. I've found that expressing the anger helps. I write really violent characters in stories and sing opera. It helps. I just have to get it out when I feel myself worked up. 

If I can't get it out right there because I would cause pain to others, I just shut everything out with headphones and avoid contact until I can calm down. 

I'm sorry you're angry. Really. I know what that burning rage is like. Over nothing. Just fury. You're not alone and you're not a bad person for making a cruel decision. You just have to make kinder decisions tomorrow. 

I have a clinical lack of empathy and had a stint with manipulative behavior and cruelty because I was angry and it was all I could feel. 

One day I just didn't want to hurt people anymore. I didnt want people to be afraid of me. I tried to be kinder and I am now. The rage doesnt control you. You're much stronger than it. 

Hope that helps."
261,I feel like I'm actually losing my mind,"Hey there. This sounds like it could be a symptom of OCD. I’m not a doctor though, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 

Either way, nothing terrible is happening, you are just having symptoms of mental illness. Can you get treatment at this point? Visit your psychiatrist, perhaps re-evaluate your medications? Is there someone in your family you can trust and open up to, at least partially? Or at least will your parents listen to you if you tell them you are not feeling well and you need to see a doctor?

No one here on Reddit can help you,unfortunately. The only helpful thing we can do is tell you to go seek treatment for your symptoms as soon as possible, because it seems like they are severe."
262,How do you stop self-hatred?,"From my point of view, self-hatred comes in a lot of ways. It can come from the way you view yourself physically, emotionally, socially, etc. For looks, people might feel disappointed that they don’t fulfill their ideal image of how they want to look. A healthy way people can deal with that is just self care. A balanced diet and workout can boost someone’s self esteem and that will ultimately relieve them from feeling so insecure and bitter towards themselves. I think one way people can truly find a way to escape self-hatred is to explore themselves socially. Meeting people who are genuine nice people will change the way you think about yourself. Interacting with others is a way of self improvement and overall self growth. Self-hatred can be quite general and can be caused by a lot of things; everyone has a different way of handeling it. But they just be willing to put forth effort to change that by helping themself, whether that’s by putting on make up, going on a jog or just by interacting with new people/old friends. Sorry for the long response - this all just comes from my own personal experience and point of view. Hope everything works out for you :-)"
263,I’m losing all hope,"You’re stuck. I get it. Things like high school may seem extremely pointless to you, I assume. There’s no easy way to break this to you, but if you truly want to escape this lethargic hell, you have to help yourself. People will be there to help you, you are not alone. High school is a step in the process of helping yourself. Going to class is a step. Going to college is a step. Getting a job is a step. Those are all steps to help yourself and there is no need to rush yourself. You don’t need to conquer the world and earn a diploma to feel good about yourself. Getting out of bed is already an achievement and making your bed is another one. Take baby steps. One step at a time. You will eventually get better at taking those steps again and you’ll find your own pace. Therapy is always an option for you; it’s a big step a lot of people fear. But you have to help yourself, please. You have to take steps to help yourself. Just at your own pace."
264,I dont know what is wrong with my mind.,"Sounds more like megalomania and narcissism than OCD to me. That doesn’t mean you’re an asshole though. If everyone was on the same page then there would be a lot less pain and strife in the world. 

Everyone in the world is always fighting because they believe that their idea of life is better than someone else’s .

Maybe the idea of life is infinite. Every person has something to contribute to the understanding of how people “should think”.

If that is true than you must assume that your own understanding is partially flawed. To perfect your thinking you have to understand as many people and groups as possible."
265,Saw horrible images on the internet. Cannot get over it,I would suggest maybe going to see a therapist. They probably could help you with this type of thing. Best of luck!
266,i feel like im going crazy please help,was this like sleep paralysis ? you can chat with me
267,feel like killing myself after this happened?,"Hey there. I get it’s hard to get bitched at like this, especially because of something that’s a sore spot already. Just remember there’s a lot of bullies online and not everyone is who they say they are. Try not to share any personal information with people you meet on dating apps (that includes dick pics). Do not make yourself vulnerable in any way, shape or form. And for this time remember, this is just some troll who has nothing better to do. They don’t have the right to affect you that way. Block them and move on. Trust me, both of you will forget about this whole thing very soon. 

Hopefully you’ll be more careful next time. Please don’t provide any information about yourself until you meet the person in real life and feel like you can trust them. 

You also might want to get your symptoms under control before dating. The dating world is ruthless and stressful and severely affects your self-esteem. You need to be in a good place mentally before you start dating, exactly because you don’t want something unpleasant but insignificant to make you feel suicidal. Take care."
268,I dissociate to levels where I don’t feel like I’m real anymore,"Thank you for sharing, I usually feel like this, and have for many years. You are not crazy;  dissociation is often a normal response to severe emotional pain and trauma. It's a part of being a person for many, many people. Some times it will go away on it's own, sometimes not. Medication, dialogue, or meditation may or may not help. Explore options with an open mind and healthy spekticisim. You can learn to think yourself out of it, but be careful not to delve into the delusional. Try researching some basic philosophy, psychology, and anthropology to help with existential disconnection. Exore new ways to connect with others. You can also go to the Buddhist route and embrace as a positive taste of being as well. Experiment with altered state and necuroactive chemicals/activities to see what balance of things like exercise, drugs, social interactions, etc. break you out of the state. Hope this helps you find some kind of path to start on. Fair warning, if you stay dissociated too long, it can be be harder to find grounding again. I think its something that's best to address hard and fast, lest it start to change the way you think too much. That said, there is not ticking clock on thses issues either, it's just easier to get back to a better baseline when you don't let dissociation become a way of life. Good luck."
269,Recovering from religion. I need help please. In agony...,Had the same problem woth the curch of christ... Just remind yourself of all ot the hate and bigortry and high horse riding you have every right to find your own spiritual path
270,I posted this to askatherapist but no one has responded. Even just thoughts from anyone who has been helped by therapy in any way would be appreciated.,"Hello there. You know, once I was in a mental hospital recovering from a breakdown and there was a psychiatry resident on my case and at some point during a meeting she just looked at me and said “you need to talk a lot to someone. Medication is one thing, but you really need to unload all your thoughts on someone. I suggest you see a therapist.”

There are many reasons people go into therapy, but the most basic one is to be heard. Because when you talk out loud, you see your problems in a different way. You need an attentive ear, and a lot of time to express yourself. Please find a good therapist and “unload” all your heavy thoughts onto them. That’s what they are there for. You will feel better once you’ve stopped keeping everything inside, and it seems like you are keeping a LOT inside. 

Once you’ve gotten rid of this almost physical weight, you will feel a space in which to think clearly, in order to improve your life. But the first step for you is to be heard and just get it out there. Seeing a therapist will help you a lot, I think. It won’t make things better right away, you will need time. But if my own experience is worth anything, I bet that you’ll be slightly relieved temporarily even after a few sessions. There’s nothing that compares to being heard in a safe space. That’s what therapy is for. So yes, it’s worth it. 

Hang in there"
271,YAYY!!,Way to go! It's huge to have someone to talk to and depend on. That's awesome
272,I want to get better,"A therapy skill that would be helpful is ""interpersonal effectiveness"". I know The Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook has it but probably others do as well.

With my mom, I don't blame her for the things that she did that fucked me up - she a fallible person doing the best that she could. But it's still ok for me to mourn the childhood and quality of life that I didn't (and still don't) have.

Your feelings of bitterness aren't going to disappear overnight. For me it took years. But the fact that you want to address it shows me that you're going in the right direction."
273,tw: mentally abusive parents/ mention of rape.,"I wanted to let you know that I read your post. I unfortunately don’t have enough mental energy to give you a full response touching on each aspect you brought up, but thought I should at least let you know that your feelings are justified and I understand what you’re going through. It’s amazing you have been able to figure out and become aware of the abusive, manipulating behavior that you have been subjected to by your mother/parents. What you described of your mother is not normal, and reminds me a lot of my mother actually. Even the mention of rape part! One day my mom would be all loving and tell me horrific stories about a rape/murder that occurred in her old apartment complex and how she doesn’t want me to move out because of dangers like that but then a week later she would threaten to kick me out! So what you said definitely resonated with similar behaviors my toxic, emotionally abusing mother did when I lived at home. From your explanation, it seems like you are the scapegoat of the family. If you haven’t looked into that term, I suggest you do, as it may actually be really helpful for you. And guess what? If you weren’t in the picture anymore, the scapegoat role would probably just be transferred to someone or something else! That’s how it works. It’s not that YOU are inherently bad. It’s that for some reason, you ended up being the “punching bag” per se. I was the scape goat of my family. After I moved out, guess what? My mother and step-dad moved the scapegoat role onto my sister! And after my sister moved out, my mother literally went on to my step-dad! For me, it helped to move out of the house obviously, but it also significantly helped to look at the situation from a “phenomena” type of view. Instead of letting myself healthily experience emotions related to my family, I now dissociate and look at my toxic family dynamic in an “observational” and neutral way. Instead of trying to personally understand and fix my family’s toxic/abusive dynamic, I now am literally intrigued by what I see as this weird (social?) phenomena. Removing an emotional connection from them prevents me from letting the abuse harm me (as much). It’s messed up and no one should have to emotionally distance or emotionally remove themselves from their family but you have to do what’s best for you. Also, I have no idea what actual psychologists suggest, so please be careful if you do decide to purposefully try to emotionally distance yourself from your mother/parents! Anyways sorry for what turned out to be a pretty long response but just know that you are validated and what you are experiencing is well-known to some people, especially people in the mental health community!! Just because some or all of your family members don’t understand or believe your situation, doesn’t mean you aren’t experiencing something serious."
274,confused and numb,i feel exactly like this. i cant get out of bed most of the times. i wanna be myself again but idk what to do.
275,i want to break myself down and build myself back up,I definitely understand this... chin up
276,What SHOULD therapy look like?,"I had a similar experience with therapy

It was heavily small talk for me. I would feel unsatisfied following sessions, as I felt that I could have talked to anyone with the same results

My psychiatrist mentioned CBT and therapy where, I suppose, there’s a goal involved. It sucks that this didn’t make much of a difference for you. Finding a fitting therapist seems like luck, unfortunately"
277,Just a question,Dermatillomania is a skin picking disorder and can be (most likely is) related to anxiety
278,I (18FwADHD moderate?depression) think I have. Borderline Personality Disorder. Impulsively put 40 lethal pills in my mouth yesterday and promptly spat them out. I was arguing with someone and right in front of them when this happened. Also having a pregnancy scare. Help?,"I’m a 22 year old male who has BPD. BPD for me is characterized by a pattern of strong and intense moods that are beyond my control after a minor event causes me to overreact. In an average day I experience rage, suicidal ideation, and close to euphoric happiness. If not set off I feel absolutely nothing for a majority of the day besides irritation. The thing is, this is how my entire life has been since I was in middle school, and no matter if my objective quality of life is great or horrible, I experience the same mood fluctuations. 

That doesn’t even go over the identity and self esteem issues that go with BPD. When I draw myself I draw a body with a blank face, as I don’t identify myself with anything. It’s a lonely experience and all you want is love or someone to connect to but at the same time you can’t gain that because of the moods. 

I think you are going through a horrible and stressful time and freaked out. Unless you can get diagnosed and recognize long term behavioral, identity, and emotional issues, I doubt BPD is it."
279,No drive,Volunteer for something that interests you. Hard to find the motivation but feels good to do something good
280,Is this what anxiety feels like? Or am I just dumb?,This is likely an indicator of anxiety and/or PTSD.
281,"I dont know whats wrong with me, and i dont know who else to turn to.","This sounds really distressing. I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this.

282,This is my gut instinct or is depression running my life?,"Remember that man is water, able to take the shape of any life. If you want to be happy anywhere, you have to make the circumstances of happiness possible for yourself. You aren't just going to fall into a life catered to what you'll be fulfilled by, unfortunately.

Customer service is hard, but ask people above you if they would be willing to teach you to be more assertive and comfortable in conversation, dont be afraid to admit faults and ask for help. 

Feeling this down about life is a self fulfilling prophesy. We like to think that the chaos around us and factors like genetics, upbringing, and psychology doom us out of the gate, but everyone can be happy. 

Read this again. 

Everyone can be happy. That means you. 

Take that chaos and those social qualms and change them. You have remarkable amounts of pull in how you look at the world. Engage with people to forget your social hang ups and try to find something in your work to take pride in. Wake up early and cook tasty breakfasts for yourself and go jogging or fishing; get some vitamin D. 

If you feel like life could be better, then make it better. If you feel like you're not good enough to make life better, make yourself better. 

There is a whole lot of negative media that normalizes sitting in depression. Waiting for things to change around you or for someone to help you. Sometimes we all feel helpless, so feeling like it's okay to feel bad is fine for a little bit but I have every confidence in you that once you feel like you've had enough, once you put your foot down and start changing your life, you can make things great for yourself. Just wait. And I'll be rooting for ya right here from this thread."
283,Idk who I am,"I have no advice to offer as I am in a similar boat. 

I am just becoming aware of it, but it is like i have different personalities that rotate. I just want to take one (my main and normal one) and make it permanent. I only became aware of this when I was basically in a state of psychosis and felt like I had traveled dimensions but really it was a personality change. 

Ive been in a weird place since then. Ive set up an appointment with a therapist. Im nervous and scared, but I am here for you. I hope it gets better."
284,19 [M] I am not feeling well and might commit suicide,"The only advice I can offer is to change your perspective on life amd stop linking your self worth to your career path...
It seems like the whole realisation about your career is new... try to give it time, finish school get your qualifications, you'll eventually find a new direction in life."
285,Self love is NOT Narcissism.,i love you too... soo.... marriage? i mean... the heart symbol kind of sealed the deal... =)
286,I feel alone.,I am so sorry you feel this way man please dont hurt yourself but we all get lonely sometimes like i am lonely all the time and i always feel like i am a third wheel but just say fuck it who cares that your friends dont see the beauty in who you are you will get over this man just stay strong nothing lasts forever like i can be your friend if you want just pm me i need new friends as well you will get over this just stay strong
287,Sensitivity to rejection or something,"Wow when you talked about how you accommodate your friends, it really lightened up my heart -- I wish I was treated like that at a friends home!! Of course minus the anxiety of rejection ;)

And no, you are not a pussy. Youve been hurt in the past and now you frantically fear rejection, and thats a totally normal thing to do. Do you  know when or why it started? 

Quick question: When you meet up with a friend (voluntarily taking your time of the day to see them and spend your freetime with them because you enjoy their company), do you want to leave after youve arrived? Do you immediately regret going there and wait for the next opportunity to get the hell out of that miserable situation?

I dont think so! So why exactly would your friends, who love and value you, want to leave you? 

I understand that these irrational thoughts cant be defeated by logic, I have them on a regular basis too. In my case, I cant believe that the person would voluntarily spend time with ME. Like what the hell? Is that person crazy? Haha I think you get the jist of it, I hope you simply realise that your friends enjoy the time with you -- otherwise they wouldnt be your friends :)"

291,I’m so fucking stupid.,well to be honest its normal for people who like to be with someone . my gf is kinda like you. I always try to push her to wrire here in reddit to get to know more people. and stay all the time with her and so on. you dont have to feel bad just cheer up and get to know new people . Many people like watching netflex together or playing games. personally I am kinda nerd guy so I usually always with her while I  play video games :p. but still no harm to have few other people in your life other than your bf.

294,Why do self-help books based on psychology suggest that you value yourself regardless of your status but then go on to say that you should strive to improve your status?,"Hokay, so

When they tell you not to base your value on ""your status"", they're basically saying, your self-worth is intrinsic, you have value, your value is not based on how the world sees you, or what you're capable of.

When they tell you to ""increase your status"" what they're *not* doing is telling you to increase your value in the eyes of others, because that's where they supposedly feel your value lies. It's not hypocritical. What they *are* telling you is that ultimately while you have inherent value, in order to find self-esteem, and importantly, to find joy in life, you need to improve that life. It needs to have value *to you*.

It's not about ""status"" because it's not about how other people see you. It's about how you see yourself. You could be shovelling pig poop and that'd be exactly what they're going for, so long as you saw that as a valuable life goal that you were happy with.

The reason they promote ""friends"" and ""doing well at work"" and ""hobbies"" is because these are classic ways that people find joy and purpose. Not because they provide status."
295,Social media platforms like Facebook Twitter and Instagram should remove the “like” feature and keep followers private,Agreed. I don't think people are aware just how dangerous Facebook and the likes actually are
296,Weird insomnia problem,"Sleep anxiety/insomnia really sucks. I find that the more anxious I am the harder it is to sleep and the less I sleep, the more my anxiety grows till I can't sleep because I'm so anxious I won't be able to get to sleep. If it wasn't so awful it would be pretty funny. 

You could look into CBT and mindfulness techniques. Doing things like not looking at your phone/watching TV just before bed can help too, along with reducing your caffeine intake (and alcohol if you drink). You sound like you exercise regularly already which is great! I often put on an audiobook to distract me as I'm trying to fall asleep. 

Outside of anxiety there are other health issues that can cause insomnia so I highly recommend that you speak to your doctor about it."
297,(UK) My long distance girlfriend just got sectioned and I don’t know what to do.,"Hey man, that sounds pretty shitty. Honestly i want to help as ive expirenced that stuff before (long distance gf cutting herself) but idk what to say, just stick with it and hopefully it will all work out"
298,I need help please,"I get this sometimes too. It’s hard. Unfortunately, we’re stuck like this. There’s no way out and we just have to accept it. You say distractions don’t help but you know the best distraction ever? Living life. Enjoy every moment. Even if you’re at home doing nothing there’s an endless amount of things just waiting to be done. You have to keep moving forward. Don’t worry about the death before it gets here, cross that bridge when you get there. The important thing to member is you’re not alone. Every single human being on this planet will die at some point and we allllll have faced this existential dread at some point. 

What helps me is the thought of the afterlife. I identify as a theist and sometimes a Christian so I believe in it. I think the thought of forever is terrifying because human brains can’t comprehend it and you fear what you don’t know. I imagine Heaven or whatever pleasurable form of afterlife as a place of neverending beauty and happiness. It comforts me"
299,What are the best ways to deal with stress and anxiety?,"I make a list of things I have to do. Everyday I get around 20 small tasks to do. It could be finishing my science homework or washing the dishes, but if something comes up that I have to do, I put it on my to do list. Then I number them depending on which task is the most important/due earliest. Ignore everything else and finish the task at hand. Slowly, but surely the huge number of things to do on the list will dwindle and disappear. :) I hope this helps!"

The single most important thing is routine, including eating, sleeping, and some form of exercise.

You have to focus on stringing days together that have food with regularity, hydration, exercise, etc.

The body will start to repair itself, and then mind will sync up and follow suit. It's no panacea, but it can make the pain *manageable*, which is where we have to start.

I damaged my wrists and now on my right hand my thumb starts to go numb and I lose gripping strength for my mouse. I can’t play for very long without it hurting. I ice my wrists while I play and do strength training for my hands and lower arms; it does not fix the problem but it helps
311,I'm not okay.,"It sounds like you already have your reason. It takes a hell of a lot of strength to stick around for those you care about.
I know sometimes it may not seem like enough motivation for you to stay, ""just"" living for other people... it sounds bleak, but seriously what other reason would you want to live for money? A career? 
Living for others is the best reason in my opinion. 


Its easier said then done but change your perspective and stop worrying about the afterlife, you're not going to find your answer. focus on living. What do you want? Do you want a family? do you want to travel? do you want to study? Even if right now you think you want nothing, think about what you used to want and start there.


Life is an absolute shit show, but it has it's moments. Give it time, you'll find your reasons."

317,My experience in a psychiatric ward,i have been in the psych ward about 5 times and all of my experiences have been positive.  it can be a very helpful place but people like to take out of the ordinary experiences and scare other people with them.
318,"I lost my grip on Reality momentarily, Should I seek help?","It would be worth checking out. Do you happen to have any history of trauma or missing periods of memory?

Edit:

I'm not presuming to know what's happening in your case, but it may be worth noting that typically when people experience deja vu, it's a sort of processing error in the brain. Our brains are notoriously unreliable at perception because they essentially edit parts of our perceived reality for the sake of efficiency. Sometimes they file information incorrectly as being familiar when it's not.

I haven't experienced a situation where I actually thought I knew something before it happened, but aside from that I did experience something basically identical to what you described. For reference, I have GAD and CPTSD. When I was a teenager I had an ongoing occurrence of deja vu in completely unknown/unfamiliar locations followed by severe anxiety and dry heaving. 

After having this happen repeatedly, I got checked out and they had no explanation. I concluded that it must be anxiety and I decided that I wasn't going to have anymore. Strangely it actually stopped. But it began to occur again about a year later. I didn't do anything about it, and I guess it went away.

I'm not sure if it was just the result of anxiety or if it was some kind of flashback experience I was having. It hasn't occurred since, but I occasionally get unexplained pain that behaves the same way (vanishes after I identify it as anxiety).

I don't know if any of that is useful to you or not, but I figured I'd share it just in case."
319,I am conflicted,"i find the definition of autism has changed in the past 13 years... my daughter was diagnosed autistic which back in 2006 was just a slower learning disorder, but then my son was diagnosed in 2018 with autism and they were using it as a ""crutch"" to explain why kids dont listen, like to act up, ect.

I try to remind myself if someone was saying the shit I tell myself then they’d be a huge asshole that deserves a punch in the throat. I’m 25 and I totally understand how your 20s are a stressful time trying to learn how to adult and dealing with all sorts of changes that overwhelm you. I’ve been to like 4 colleges over the course of 7 years and have yet to graduate with my bachelors degree because of my mental and physical health(chronic migraines) it’s definitely hard to accept that you have to go at your own pace because of your disability while your friends graduate. We’re living life on hard mode and considering that, I’m glad I’m tough enough to get through these years at least. Life isn’t a straight line and it’s gonna go off course sometimes in good and bad ways and comparing your accomplishments to others while blind to your own isn’t good. I gotta give myself a wake up slap to acknowledge the progress I’ve made and I’m being hard on myself because of my damn mental illness. Gotta do mindfulness and all that.

Btw why do you have to be “worth something”? We get drilled into our heads that we gotta have a successful life and make lots of money... but am I really unworthy of life? Who makes that decision? I exist so I have the freedom to do whatever makes me happy even if that’s a working a  job you love and doing things you love and loving life. You can be successful in so many ways... my goal is to make my loved ones happy and to volunteer rescuing animals. You’re worthy.

Sorry for ranting btw... guess I needed to write that out for my own benefit as well because I forget in my dark moments. Also a tip: people don’t post the bad shit in their lives on social media and post or fake the good stuff only so don’t compare and think everyone is happy but you. We all got problems and we gotta limit our social media time (so hard)

Good luck!"

327,My girlfriend (30F) has bipolar disorder and an eating disorder and I’m not sure what to do.,"I'm sorry to hear of your struggles. You're in a tough situation. More than likely, whether she realizes it or not, she has a history of childhood trauma or emotional neglect. She doesn't mean to behave the way she does, she's just living out old survival patterns of avoiding things and suppressing feelings. (Starvation gives a semblance of control and numbs emotions.)

She needs counseling- preferably with an eating disorder or trauma specialist. Obviously, can be all sorts of barriers there, i'm aware, so short of therapy, DBT workbooks can be helpful for people managing her symptoms. Learning about trauma is a good starting place. Read and YouTube all you can find about CPTSD, developmental trauma and BPD.

Know her triggers are probably surrounding real or perceived abandonment; it may be you need to reassure her more often than you're accustomed. She will likely push you away in order to reenact her abandonment illusions. 

Learning about attachment theory will help also, as she probably has an insecure attachment style that negatively impacts all her significant relationships. *Attached* by Levine and Heller is a good, comprehensive overview with self and partner assessments. (Some assert that healing attachment issues can resolve most every psychiatric disorder.)

Anyhow, it's a long road, takes a lot of empathy and patience, but it can and will get better. Take care of yourself first. Best to you both."

329,Meltdown,"It's a terrible experience to drift away from the people you're close to. Despite the differences I had with all my classmates growing up, I was never without friends. 

But every year, I lost them. I'd lose the connection we had. They became vague memories that can't make me smile anymore. 

I had an amazing friend. She was kind to me, she helped me, I fell for her. Yet I never had the courage to tell her. And then she had fights with her friends. She lost one of her best friends because some bitch started up a feud. And she cried, and changed. I lost her too, and suffered my greatest heartbreak.

Now I am different. I am callous, judgmental, and spiteful. But I keep what little happiness I have left. And I stay strong for everything and everyone that made my life possible.
 For all the people who lived before me. 
For the family that loves me.
For the friends I'll make in the future.
I live to be better.

I will actively say ""im angry,  I can't talk about this now. I can talk later.""  

I suggest making it a rule when you're both calm, tell each other it's ok to be angry... and it totally is.... but there's a time for anger, venting and reliving trauma,  and a time for working things out between you two. Keep them separated. 

Is your partner interested in counseling again?  Maybe a group setting with other people with similar experiences? I know ACoA has helped me a lot with my childhood trauma.  And it's free.

You both need a lot more support than each other. There's some very serious trauma she's dealing with."

368,Deep seated sadness but I don't think it's depression?,"Ever heard of the term 'Weltschmerz'? It's German and literally translates to 'world-pain'. It's a feeling of melancholy or overall sadness when thinking about the poor condition the world is in, all the pain and suffering....it's a somewhat pessimistic view of the world. I've been in a similar state when I was in my teens and I kept thinking about all the suffering going on around me and I realized that caring too much hurts. It hurts to bear the pain of the world and it's too much for one person to carry. Yet, that's what happened when I became aware of all those bad things happening all around me. I learned that we as individuals carried little meaning in the bigger picture, that we are brought into this flow of life and if we departed the world would still keep turning. 

To learn all of that opened my eyes. I could see, but it planted this kind of emptiness inside of me. A kind of pain I couldn't put a finger on and it's still there. I don't know what to name it and I'm still considering going to see a mental health professional since I've been having some issues for some time now. Maybe you should do the same.

379,What the fuck is wrong with me?,"I'm no expert, but there are some thoughts from what you've said that could help you identify the problem, come to terms with it and try to accept it and change.

&#x200B;

Firstly, I don't think it's ever too late to change. Just because you behaved in a certain way in the past, doesn't mean people hold you to that personally, nor will people remember things to the exact same detail that you do. It's like when you have an argument with a friend a while ago, people rarely think back to that exact argument and use that as part of their overall judgement of you. It's more to do with ourselves and we tend to dwell on things we don't feel good about and project them onto others so we often end up assuming that others see it the same way, when in most cases, it's quite different.

&#x200B;

Regarding you not seeing previous friends as important and not knowing why, this could be a combination of things like insecurity (because of your weight), your lifestyle (moving around a lot at younger ages tends to subconsciously settle into your mind that keeping relationships with people aren't as important, because you're going to move anyway so what's the point, right?) and personal influences throughout your life.

&#x200B;

The way you could try to see it is, if those people who were friends with you and nice to you before when you were fat or ugly or whatever it may be - they accept you for who you are. These are the people you should really try to stay connected with. It's not too late to reconnect with them. I went through things myself in the past and the only way I fixed my situation was facing the ugly truth and accepting who I am. Only then could I see clearly what mattered to me, and I spent a lot more effort fixing relationships with friends and family because of this period of facing the truth.

&#x200B;

We all are lucky to be alive. Many people live in much worse situations than others, where they get physically/sexually abused, forced into slavery or worse at young ages. I get that we all take things differently as people, but just know that it's never too late to fix a problem. To fix a problem, any problem, always uses the same method.

&#x200B;

Truthfully identify the problem. Truthfully think about why the problem came to be. Truthfully ask and answer yourself whether this problem is important enough to you to be fixed. If so, truthfully explain yourself to those you care about and sort it out. What do you have to lose? Tell your friends you had an issue and have worked it out, hopefully they can understand. If they don't, well at least you know. If they do, you have another go!

&#x200B;

Too often these days people are caught up in their own insecurities, egos, pride, cultural expectations, societal standards to really face themselves and admit that they're not perfect.

&#x200B;

Yes, I am selfish in this way. Yes, I am lazy because I don't work out. Yes, I am a glutton because I don't watch my food intake. With following the truth, you will never have to worry about you or someone else questioning you, because there's nothing else to say - it's the truth. You'll know it in your heart, and others will know it when they look into your eyes and hear it in your voice.

&#x200B;

Anyway, i've rambled enough, this is just my opinion and how I changed from how I was before to how I am now and I have never looked back in regret.

&#x200B;

I hope this helps and that you can improve your situation! Good luck."

383,How do you write down your feelings?,"I find that many people don’t really know what feeling or all the feelings they currently experience. A lot of the time emotions and feelings get displaced, i.e. it’s easier to be mad instead of sad or fearful. I recommend some clients to use a feelings wheel (google search) to help identify feelings. When you start to feel overwhelmed by emotions, try to check in with yourself. What am I currently feeling right now, what was the trigger, is my feeling in proportion to the situation, is there are there multiple feelings ya going on, is there another way of thinking about this situation to lessen the feeling?  

Journaling can be helpful. It can also be a lot for a person to add on to their list of things to do. Working on mental health and self improvement can be a lot. Most people tend to be more successful at changes when starting one small thing at a time and incorporate into their lifestyle rather than a ton. If journaling feels natural to you, please do so. If not, I highly recommend just checking in with yourself a few times a day. Being more mindful of emotions and reactions.

385,"Therapist unprofessional, inappropriate?","I’ll admit I never been to couples counseling. However I’ve had many therapist for personal reasons. My first one gave me really good advice because he was a nonprofit.

The thing he made very clear while admitting he couldn’t help me but finding the right therapist will be a process. Some get lucky in the first three & others could be as many as ten attempts before you find the one that just clicks with you & you feel comfortable with. You’ll know when that will happen.

This isn’t a one & done deal. I understand it’s rough on both of you & he might be treating it like a one & done deal. I’m not saying he’s not serious but could be feeling anxious about it. So the quicker the better & this could be just because minor anxiety & that’s ok! (Hence why he would think you’re overreacting) but he’s going with the flow of you & thats why he’s okay with going to somebody else. That is a good sign that he wants to make things work between you two!

However I would say the therapist is being unprofessional about the texting. Yes a therapist needs to observe the naturalness of the conversation & chemistry & see kinda where the root is. Trying to figure out what is -the- actual problem & be observant in the first one or two sessions. Keep in mind I’m basing this off of one on one counseling & how I was allowed to ramble/vent . I think asking for a moderator is good. If that’s what you liked then do so.

No I don’t think you’re over reacting. I think you’re correct in what you have observed & if I was in your shoes I would want to try somebody else."

By letting her go, you put her first and I’m sure that wasn’t easy. I’ve recently been feeling like I’ve been unfair to my partner too bc I’m not where I want to be emotionally and I know its affecting our relationship.

401,"Please help me help my girlfriend, I am somewhat lost.","Peace, your GF's sudden mood flips and anger issues may  be due to her having weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack  of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an  issue, however, you should be seeing 4 other warning signs.

The  first is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few  months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over  harmless events -- or tried to isolate you away from close friends and  family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as  your choosing THEM over HER.

Second,  you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein  she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad""  (""against me"") and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds --  from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. If so,  this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of  all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""

Third,  you would not see her expressing her anger to total strangers (e.g.,  road rage against strangers). Rather, the outbursts and temper tantrums  almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e.,  against YOU or her parents).

Fourth,  you often would see her flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and  devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on  eggshells. Have you been seeing these 4 red flags?"
402,Prescribed Zoloft,"For some people, the side effects wear off between 2 weeks and a month. I took zoloft for 4 months and it still made me feel as sick as the first week, I told my doctor multiple times, and eventually they weaned me off and had me try paroxetine. (I believe this is generic for prozac) and this has been my go-to since. I have had a much better experience and the initial side effects were hardly noticeable. If the zoloft still isnt sitting well with you after a month, I would suggest talking to your doctor about trying a different medication. Idk if prozac would work for you, but I have a great experience with it. Best of luck to you ♡"

I'll be honest with you -- there are a lot of tough days. A lot of the time it's a chore to get out of bed and to take a shower. You just want to sleep the pain away because it's the only way you get peace.

But there comes a point where it gets easier to get out of bed, take a shower, put on some clothes, and leave the house. And sometimes a really difficult event in your life can trigger an episode all over again. 

It's been three-years since my last serious episode and I'm beginning to fall into the pitfalls of Depression again. I was also just diagnosed with PTSD after being triggered by running into my sexual abuser at a family event I was told he  would not be attending. 

I'm convinced we will always have Depression, but that doesn't mean we have to let it win. It does get easier eventually once you learn how to cope (healthy).

I never cut as a result of bullying but it did deeply impact me. I became insecure, anxious, and depressed. I still suffer with these issues today. I know elementary and middle school were hard but in my experience people are less harsh in High school. Try and make new friends. People who are genuinely nice and have depth to them.

427,Talk to me about social anxiety disorder,"Hello, I feel similar things as you do. I have had a couple of years of therapy which was mostly about working with mindfulness.. I'm not professional and these are my personal opinion and experiences.


I get triggered by sounds, certain feelings people ""give off"" based on absolutley ridiculous things, when I go out my eyes get crazy and it's like anything is threatening, everything is like a hundred times more lound, it gets tiering and I end up getting a tunnel vision.


Mindfulness has helped me alot, and it still does but the thing is I've been feeling like it's just a band aid on my traumas. In my opinion, ways of coping like mindfulness are necessary, but if it just keeps going on and on maybe there's something else to look at? I have been told many times by my ""ex"" therapist that it was so unnecessary to go back in time and try to ""fix"" things or make them a little better, but now with my experiences I disagree and wish I could actually get the help that I need but as you said $$$.


So back to coping I would highly suggest mindfulness, if you have specific situations that triggers you, exposure to it can eventually make it seem a little less and a little less fearful. Once you start getting used to something don't let it go, you might end up ""restarting"" your hard work all over again. I can go out ""fine"" for a week but then don't go out for 3 days out of fear and i'm back at the start personally.


I could almost never look at people in the eyes when I spoke with someone, but as I practiced having conversations, socializing, and making eye contact it got a little more easier, althought now that I have been pretty Isolated it went a few steps back. I want friends but I don't simply because I don't know how to act anymore, what am I supposed to be doing with friends? I feel so awkward! But then again at some point we need to socialize eventually. Often when we have a good time with someone we feel energized or very tired but in a good way.



I think once we start being so harsh and judgmental towards our own selves things get a little easier. If I can't change a negative thought about myself I will at least try to push it away until it's completely gone. I derailed hope this makes sense, sorry for the long comment lol."
428,Maintaining hobbies with depression,Hey - I'm not sure on that one. We are meant to fake it till we make it right? There are lots of things I don't do because of depression but there are some things I hyper focus on...like knitting.
429,"I Don’t feel emotions, just numb","I have something similar.

&#x200B;

Numbness is usually a sign of depression.

&#x200B;

some say it's a medical condition you're born with, but others say it's a product of your childhood. I believe in the later.

&#x200B;

Sometimes, when children experience bad things/feelings, they numb out as a way to cope with the situation since they haven't been taught how to properly manage their feelings. This is more common amongst children of broken homes or children of alcoholics, abusers, etc. If this goes on long enough it becomes a habit, and eventually just becomes a state of being. 

&#x200B;

It's useful in childhood to get you through the hard times, but once you're an adult on your own, away from whatever was hurting you, it becomes a serious detriment. 

&#x200B;

Have you ever experienced periods of apathy and numbness that were so strong you spend unusual amounts of time in bed? like a whole day? A few days? a week or more?

&#x200B;

Do you frequently have negative thoughts or feelings about yourself? Or is your inner voice very critical and abusive towards you?

These are just a few signs of depression. 

&#x200B;

You're still very young though, so it's likely that therapy can help turn this around. Worst case scenario you can try an anti-depressant + therapy + self help books.

&#x200B;

It seems impossible, but people have made it through this. You can too.

&#x200B;

Hit me up if you have questions"
430,"How do I get myself out of this depressive state I'm in. I used to be so bubbly and funny to be around but in recent years I have had a huge amount of trouble at home, in work especially and feel like my friends don't want much to do with me anymore.","Losing friends or the perception of your friends not wanting to be around you is a big symptom of the depression, wether or not the feelings are the truth, it's important that you seek to improve your mental state. Depending on where you're from, you have some options. 

The first option would be to look at new medication, right now you're on an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) for your depression. These are being replaced with a new type of depression medication that affects more than just serotonin uptake, sometimes these are more effective as they affect multiple receptors in your brain and have an effect on dopamine as well. I'm on one that has worked wonders for me, it's called [Vortioxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296590/) 

>vortioxetine is pharmacologically different than other SSRIs because it also works by direct modulation of various serotonin receptors.[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296590/#b4-ptj4001036)–[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296590/#b5-ptj4001036) Chronic therapy with early approved antidepressants causes a desensitization of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) on the presynaptic neuron, thereby creating a negative feedback loop and possibly reducing their antidepressive effects. Vortioxetine is an agonist of 5-HT1A on the presynaptic neuron, which can accelerate the antidepressant effects, similar to pindolol, and incorporate serotonin transporter (SERT) blockade.[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296590/#b5-ptj4001036)–[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296590/#b8-ptj4001036) This molecule acts as an antagonist, agonist, and partial agonist of multiple serotonin receptors and is designed to help reduce depressive symptoms for treatment and maintain response.

&#x200B;

This being said, there are other medications and/or treatments available. This is just one of the options, as it sounds like the meds aren't doing their job for you. 

&#x200B;

I think when depression feels like it's saving such an effect on your life, getting medication sorted is your number one solution. Depression can also be a symptom of other underlying conditions that your doctor may not have diagnosed, for example: I was diagnosed with ADHD after a long time, and that going untreated lead to my depression getting so bad that it needed treatment as well. So getting a second opinion is always valuable if you can afford it or have those resources around you. 

&#x200B;

Now for a more anecdotal view. Depression to me, is your body and mind telling you that you aren't behaving the way *you want to* behave. Meaning you know you could/should be doing things differently but have trouble because of the effects of the mental illness. There is a book called ""wisdom for the age of anxiety"" by Alan Watts, I highly recommend this for anybody struggling with depression and anxiety, it's done me wonders. Becoming ""not depressed"" is a matter of shifting the way you view the world and how you respond to things (such as bullying at work). Medication simply helps you to shift your views, you can do it on your own in ways as well, the book referenced above is a great start for that. 

&#x200B;

Finally, i'd say that clearly you're aware something isn't right, and you probably have goals related to your friendships and relationships in general. You're doing good to see that things are changing and you're trying to correct course, this is very important and good. Since you have recognized this all, I have no doubt that you will be able to feel like your ""old self"" again. Set yourself a realistic timeline for getting better, maybe 1-2 years. Over this time, you'll slowly work on changing your behaviours related to problematic things in your life, and slowly your perspective will change. Again, I think medication is always a good one to work on getting right, if it's not doing it's job then its not the one for you most likely. Then you can comfort yourself and learn in the meantime by reading, and listening to positivity. Things will get better, just remember it won't happen over night, this takes time and that's totally okay. 

&#x200B;

You don't need anyone like that in your life, and you've no reason to stick around there without him, so just call your dad and say you want to come home and if you want to leave on good (referencey) terms then tell your employers that you're moving away for personal reasons and can't continue to work there; but tbh I've just walked out of jobs when I felt they weren't even worth sticking out the week or what and it's never had any effects (at least, that I know of...) getting work in the future

Anyway besides all that, you're worth way more than putting up with even half of that shit and hurting yourself or letting yourself be treated badly by others is fucking awful and nothing is worth that so don't feel ANY duty or obligation to shit that is remotely harmful to you; there's always other people, other jobs, other apartments and other cities, but there's only one you, you're unique and special and please just get away from that toxic situation and find something better, please?"

443,I felt a moment of true happiness,I feel like this when the summer weather finally starts to kick in. I'm convinced the winter makes me more depressed.
444,I think I just need to vent.,"As far as your own health, I strongly suggest ditching those pharma tablets because it's terrible for you. I highly recommend taking CBD orally or smoking it (even strains with THC for pain ease). This will help your sensitive nervous system as well as inflammation. Health is wealth. I have SI joint pain. I'm thinking from improper posture and working on my car/lifting heavy just worn out the muscular area. Its totally manageable for me (luckily). Take a look into yoga poses and stretching. There are movements you can practice to help the disc. Go on Instagram and check out a bunch of physical therapy accounts. There is so much free info being posted.
Now about your past friends... It just goes like that. Everyone moves on. I know a bunch of people and have many close friends but the amount of times I hang around them? Barely any.  Once you are in a long term relationship and start a family, that's what happens. The only way anyone gets in touch with friends/family is social media. People come and go. I find it depressing myself. You can find a hobby to get into and hope there is something local to find potential friends. 

Family always comes first though. Dealing with health issues of a significant other is tough. Not just for the person who has it, but the effort you put into to be there for him/her during check ups/exams and all that can get exhausting. But that's the tough part about love. It's amazing but also challenging. It's confusing in a way. There's many directions of it but in the end, you care for the person and would do anything for them. I know someone who is losing his wife to stage 4 cancer this year. I can sense his pain.. it's so hidden. Young kids too. It's unfortunate. Life just beats us down and sometimes we all want to blow our brains out because we can't stand it anymore. Once in a while I become unmotivated by the daily routine throughout the week. It's like I'm eager to find a new spark in life. Just something to change it up.

Make the effort to start a project or get into disciplining yourself with fitness. Get your mind right and active. Best of luck.

446,Tips for enduring a panic attack?,"I know this is gonna sound a bit weird, but for me what really helped me endure a panic attack was to hold my breath. When I get my panic attacks, I typically hyperventilate really bad to the point that my face goes numb and I can't walk. Although one day out of the blue, I thought why don't I try to hold my breath? I've tried breathing exercises but they don't work that well for me. I hold my breath for as long as I can so that when I breathe again, it forces my body to take in a deep breath. Surprisingly enough, it works like a charm. My breathing is back on track and that's the start to feeling better for me. Although I don't know if it's a safe thing to do? But so far, I haven't died so I'll take it."
447,I am not well,"It sounds like you've weighed the pros and cons; cutting off your toe would be permanent. You'd live with it forever. It sounds like you've acknowledged the negatives of such an action.  


What have you tried to do to cope with these thoughts? How have you stopped yourself from giving in to them?  


I've had cannibalistic thoughts. Mine were intrusive OCD style thoughts, so a tad different, but the subject is familiar. Remember, ""normal"" is relative. Wellness is a better word. I've worked in the mental health field awhile, and I'll tell you I don't see a huge difference between my clients and neurotypical society.   


What are your motivations for increasing your functionality and being well? There is a lot of help available in the field. I'd encourage you to explore. A support group also helps ease the loneliness. I personally utilize peers, family, and friends as support."

I hate to suggest socialising because though it can make some of us feel great it can also make us feel even more withdrawn.

I'm not bipolar but I was once disconnected for an entire year, flat out emotionless, unwilling to socialise, move, and I was desparate to feel anything. 

Music no longer brought me happiness
Interaction no longer brought me happiness
Existence in itself no longer brought me happiness


I learned that I was alone, and that I must deal with this alone. Research, abandon everyone, you are your own master and better yet everyone's master, be powerful. 

If you beleive in a truth spread it
No matter how agressive or defensive others get 
Stand for your ground

Develop a sense of identity, and let everyone know that you're better than them 


Maybe try getting a pet to care for? Though I'm not sure on how this may help as you're a male and the female and male got very different instincts.

I never had anything to say because I had nothing, I felt nothing. Try learning about many subjects, develop a sense of curiosity, make that your truth.

I feel like I should start taking them again but I’m not sure.,"Try working on your mental health other way maybe like going out on walks and working out or doing some kind of physical hobby. You can go back anytime back to meds if it becomes too hard. But if you are managing try working on yourself. Make small positive changes
I had the same issue with meds making me more anxious or feel dead inside so I stopped taking them after a while coz they didn’t do what they were supposed to. And now I’m dealing with insomnia because of that. 
Wish you the best."
455,I feel like I'm slowly falling into nothing,"Hey, what i do wrong is im not vocal enough. Stand your ground and be loud say what you want and need. When speaking to the doctor say exactly what you wrote. Be as clear as possible. If your meds are having the opposite effect which is very likely it happens to me about 90percent of meds i tried. Maybe change the doctor try slowly getting off your meds depending how long youve been taking them ask the doctor how to safely get off them. If they dont tell you then do the thing you did just in reverse. Or try asking in the pharmacy they can be helpful. Tell your bf whats going on so he knows that its a hard time now and if you act “weird” that it’s because of what you described. 
But mostly i would change my doctor. Coz if you’re getting worse and hes ignoring it thats a bad sign. 
I know meds can make you feel really weird and uncomfortable. Some people need to try different ones til they find the med that fits and the dose. 
The thing about your parents, you seem underage then? Try talking to a trusted adult maybe counselor and maybe let them speak to you r parents? I didn’t get that really. 
Be loud about your problems. Stand up louder"
456,I’m not sure I’m cut out for being human.,"I feel the exact same way, especially with the hate. I don't understand why there is so much of it and why people don't treat others with any respect. Like common kindness."
457,My mom is schizophrenic and I'm not sure what to say.,"The best middle ground you can get is affirming her feelings, and that she really is experiencing what she is experiencing, even though you are not experiencing the same thing.  Saying ""I don't see that, but you clearly do,"" is better than, ""No, that's not there."" Unless it's on the early/mild side it doesn't help to directly contradict a delusion or hallucination. With milder delusions it can help to ask questions, like ""Why would they be spying on you? What do they have to gain?"" These questions won't dissuade her from her delusion, but they might help her to gain insight into the fact that she is delusional."
458,Has anyone tried Dynamic Interpersonal Therapy (DIT) or longer-term psychodynamic therapy? How did you find it compared to other talking therapies?,Longer term psychodynamic helped me because most of my anxieties and behaviours came from childhood. CBT didn’t help me but I do actually practise CBT myself now and find it’s helpful if you do the exercises yourself alongside the other therapy.
459,I don’t know what to do.,"I think you should tell your therapist how uncomfortable and how anxiety-inducing this statement made you feel. 

Even if you do plan on leaving and working with a new therapist, I think it would be good for this therapist to hear and understand the implications of what their statement meant. 

&#x200B;

I just started going to therapy, and there are times that I too question something my therapist said. When I bring them up to her, she'll give me more insight into what she meant, or other times I just completely misread some sarcasm or her trying to lighten the mood. 

&#x200B;

I don't think that is necessarily the case here, but I do think it is absolutely worth it to be forthright with this therapist and have them understand that their statement held a lot of weight."

464,"My friend spontaneously went insane, hasn't slept in days and is acting really strange","I'm not an expert but that sounds like it could be a severe manic episode or a psychosis, which could manifest itself in many disorders. And by the way, I've read that schizophrenia can occur in the early 20s."
465,Please help my friend,"sounds like your friend possibly has a personality disorder or some form of a bipolar disorder. I’d  recommend her to a psychiatrist  for an evaluation. This may be hard for her to do, but it will help her in the long run."
466,Valueable TED talk,"As someone with NPD traits, I really do feel that. People are quick to judge and despite all that talk of empathy people give out when it comes to those who self-harm/suicidal/depressed, no one will ever want to shed a tear with a person who has a different mindset that affects them negatively. I genuinely believe that being good is pointless when everyone is a hypocrite."
467,"I actually combed out my hair today, which is a bigger deal than it sounds..",Wow! Congratulations. It’s so difficult when depression makes self care so hard. I always have a hard time getting the energy to brush my teeth when I’m feeling more depressed than usual. Try to remember how great it feels to have nicely combed hair. That might help right now. Hope your seed of pride keeps growing.
468,Spiraling,"If I may ask, why don't you take them?"
469,I'm really struggling.,"I'm a college lecturer so I completely understand the pressure you're under at the moment. I know how stressed my students get when trying to complete the course. 

But give yourself a big pat in the back for making it through very demanding times and I know how tough it can be to get into an apprenticeship. You've done so well and you just need to keep focusing on the end goal and what you will have achieved. 

I know that may seem hard but other are probably in the same position as you and more than likely feeling very similar about things. Just keep thinking positive and work at a pace that comfortable for you. I'm sure if you have a tutor that is understanding they will be more than happy to offer you support. 

You're doing great ☺️"
470,How do I help my Anorexic friend eat???,"You can't.

And 'feeding' people struggling with anorexia can be particularly dangerous. Depending on how serious her condition is, she could be at risk for refeeding syndrome during the process of relearning to eat and may need to be medically monitored. It can be fatal. Most eating disorder treatment programs are extremely adapt are treating 'classic' anorexia symptoms as they tend to manifest themselves in similar ways in similar personalities (this is OBVIOUSLY not always true - I don't know your friend and do not claim to) and she may need a higher level of care if she is not eating all day. it is very rare for a profession to allow outpatient therapy for the combination of low body weight and continued reduced caloric intake."
471,Nothing is ok. 92% of people are assholes.,"Sometimes I feel that way too honestly. But you are still here and there is a purpose for that. The world is a cruel place is just having a kind person like you here makes things a little better. That smile that you give people give some hope in a world that seems so dark. They may not acknowledge you for it or let you know but trust that it doesn’t go unnoticed. I just recently became a nurse and so many patients don’t say anything to let me know if I’ve helped them in any way, but when one or two does, it let’s me know that I do make a difference even if only a few tell me so. When you meet kind hearted people like yourself, it makes the moment that more special because we are rare."
472,Not sure if this is the correct subreddit... but I had a question about inpatient voluntary stays. Relative is trying to appeal her stay. What's that process like?,"I’ve only been on the patient side.

In my experience people can leave AMA or earlier than their docs might otherwise want if it’s a voluntary hospitalization, but once it’s an involuntary one you really have no say. You can ask, appeal, whatever, but unless there was some really big screw up (someone intentionally overstating your need to be hospitalized or something), it’s more to give a patient a sense of control than anything else. Especially if you as a patient are being non-compliant. 

I’d talk to the admitting physician, if it’s a hospital they work with a lot they’ll have a firm answer for you about how the process works.  If you have to be chemically sedated during an involuntary admit you’re probably not going anywhere for quite a while."
473,changing therapists and losing all my friends,"“The process on the other hand is hard and annoying.” It is exactly that and more. But it is worth, I promise. Am also bipolar (depressive, can’t remember if that’s I or II), plus some other stuff mixed in. A good therapist is key. I’m so sorry you clicked with one who doesn’t take your insurance. Can they recommend someone who offers similar treatment? I went through a few therapists until I found the right one. Meds are also key, and finding the right one or combo is frustrating to say the least. 

As far as friends, many people dipped out on me. My real friends (both of them) stuck with me. But once you’re settled better mentally, you make friends as you go. As you get older, though, it gets harder. Most of my friends are online. But I travel a lot, so that’s no biggie. Concentrate on yourself self right now. You’ll need every bit of you to do this. But it does get better, I promise! DM me anytime."
474,Reasons why some countries have higher suicide rates than others and what they can learn from countries with low suicide rates.,"Why is no one funding this research?!

From what I know I think it’s culture related. Like in South Korea mental illness is frowned upon, although there’s more support in USA you have to pay for it and there’s still stigma, also some countries are more “goal orientated” - like in the UK where I am you’ll hear a lot of “I’ll be happy when I graduate” or “I’ll be happy when I move”, “I’ll be happy when I find love” etc. No one just...lets themselves feel. People try to control emotions or seek things to blame rather than reflecting and growing. We have goals and when we can’t reach them, or even worse, we reach them and still feel awful, we spiral. 

I can’t be certain but I’d guess it’s very much related to cultural stress and stigma."
475,I am a shitty piece of trash,"at some point in your life you get tired of unhealthy connections, whether it be ppl or things. as you continue to grow, certain things become intolerable to your life satisfaction but know that that’s okay. you don’t have to force anything that doesn’t feel like it’s meant to be. we have to learn how to train our mind to be stronger than our emotions or else we’ll lose every time. 
big part in becoming an adult is unlearning a lot of the shit you were taught by ppl who didn’t know what they were doing either. one of the most challenging things i had to learn is that healing must be intentional. healing is a practice. you have to decide that it’s what you want to do& actively do it. you have to make a habit out of it. once i finally learned that i only looked back to see how far i came.

Break up with the negative self-talk, with telling yourself what you can’t do, with self-sabotage. Get angry about this & use the anger to power you. You’re worth more than what you’ve allowed, & now, it’s time to get serious about yourself. You can do this✨

in case you needed to read this : 
i know you might often sit holding back tears, convinced that no one cares about you, even though you know that’s not true. you feel as though your mind is simply a pawn to the lies that your brain suffocates you with, as though you are trapped, unable to escape the confining walls in which you feel unloved & unappreciated. you’ve grown & matured, you thought you were over this, but perhaps you are still somewhat insecure & that’s okay. you fear loneliness & lack of love, but that doesn’t mean these thoughts are true. your thoughts often lie to you. negative ones in particular. but in order to overcome that & not let your own thoughts control & possibly ruin you, then you must drown them out. i know it’s easier said than done. but CAN choose to ignore them b/c you ALWAYS have a choice."

477,How do I tell my doctor about my functional depression when I don't care?,"If it's causing you enough anguish to write this post then I would definitely say it is impacting your functionality in day-to-day life enough to warrant a trip to the doctors. 

I don't recommend unnecessarily medicating yourself if you feel you don't need it - but it's certainly a route of avenue for you to explore. Speaking to the correct people can actually help diagnose any disorders we might have that have come along as a result of/or predating our depression.

For example; I having an eating disorder and it is entirely mental - knowing you should eat but just not having the mental capacity to do so, to the point I will just starve. That in itself is something that has to be diagnosed and I've been put on the correct course of rehabilitation, while I'm also dealing with the reasons behind having the disorder and the ones that come as a result. 

Your mental state will be coming from somewhere, and it's best to bring these things to the attention of a doctor so that they can help identify and rectify the issue. If you feel you can't verbalise your words correctly then just let it out any way you can, whether it be in broken sentences or not. You're not alone, despite having your own troubles, I'm here if you need to talk more about it"
478,Do therapists ask you in your first session if you have a history of self-harm?,"Mine did ask, I answered ""Yes"" and he asked to see the scars. I showed him only my arms and then he made me sign a ""no harm promise""."
479,Is this normal behavior?,"You definitely sound more paranoid or anxious than schizophrenic, but I'm not sure I'd describe you as either of those either. You DO sound extremely stressed, possibly to a level of needing therapy to manage or reduce it (especially given difficult/stressful childhood). That may be an anxiety problem or you may just be highly stressed (as you said, moving and having a brother diagnosed with a serious illness like schizophrenia would be a stressful time for anyone). 

Zoning out into your inner world is probably not a helpful coping mechanism if it just stresses you further, so maybe therapy could help you to adjust that to be something more beneficial. In fact if you feel like you're having trouble coping, therapy is always a good idea. 

To me it doesn't sound like you have schizophrenia based on what you've written here but if you're worried you could always see a specialist to get their opinion."

486,I'm afraid of hitting children.,"The underlying issue I see here is that you have a self control problem. A plain as day violent temper. What's great though is you're fully aware (Cant fix a problem if you dont know it exists). Dont be too hard on yourself (Or any kids, lol). Becoming better is hard and can be discouraging. Try temper exercises or even talking to a shrink (These types of issues are commonly fixed with therapy). Do you know if it's more than just an ""annoyance with kids""? Like, were you beat growing up or raised around someone with a short temper? The origins are important. Good luck."
487,"2 months ago, I tried to end my own life","You’re amazing. To go from being in the hospital to going back to school and finishing all your courses and exams. I hope you feel proud of yourself for that. Anxiety is the worst. It filters out the positives. I know I imagine the worst and that people look down on me when I’m anxious. And hatred and shame is debilitating. I’m so sorry you are going through this right now.  And the fear of losing people just makes it so much worse. 

But recovering your self esteem is definitely possible. I’ve really improved mine, but it took me time. I wish I could give you just a few sentences to fix it all. For me, it took going to therapy to express my fears in front of another person and have empathy reflected back to me. And reading self help books and watching youtube. Brene Brown is good. Self compassion is also important. Kristin Neff has good tips.

I think if you can get your anxiety down it would make everything so much easier. I hope your doctor is helping you with that. Good for you for reaching out for help. That’s a really hard and brave step. And to realize self respect and self care are important is a great step forward. It’s really important for mental health. I wish you happier times ahead."

If you have your therapist contact number/information then text them this all or email them or even send them a letter through post. Honestly I will tell you that words written have so much power than words said and sometimes are the best way to convey feelings (that's why we have written poetry, novels etc)
The fact it takes so much courage to write this post (Tbh if I were you I won't be able to do that) You're brave and you recognize your issues and are willing to take action which means you're halfway there. So just make sure your message is reached and leave the rest to therapist, In Sha Allah your therapist will help you. Stay blessed."

Definitely try and speak to someone you trust, I know the idea is off putting - but if you burden yourself with these thoughts then they are only going to manifest further. The fact that you have said you feel you might attack someone is quite alarming (albeit very relatable), No matter what we are going through it is entirely wrong to think this way, and putting others at risk is extremely damaging in getting help for yourself. Speaking up now and explaining that these feelings are getting too much to handle on your own will definitely allow the correct type of help to be given to you. You haven't done anything wrong by the way, having these feelings are actually normal but its our ability to control them that put us and others at risk. If you ask for help in dealing with these feelings before anything happens, then you are passing the baton to someone who *should* do their job and help you seek what you need. I hope you are keeping positive"

506,Being single affecting my mental health? (Possible CW for suice and rape),"Are you in the UK? I have been on similar waiting lists to speak to somebody. It was about 9 months I waited to speak to a psychotherapist.  If this is the case for yourself, I would recommend looking at your Community Mental Health Team, they have a waiting list of around 1 month (at least where I am) and offer more services than just the psychotherapist (they have psychologists and psychiatrists available, alongside nurses). You normally need a referral from your GP, but if you explain that its the CMHT that you want to see, they should be able to point you in the right direction. A psychotherapist is only good for talk therapies, it's a psychiatrist and psychologist you would need to speak to about any medication/drug related topics. I learned this out after a gruelling wait. 

&#x200B;

514,Share your experience of Withdrawal Symptoms from your psychiatric meds,"With Effexor please follow the guidelines set forth by your care provider (hopefully a psych). I have know many people who have been on Effexor and it is a rough med to get off of. I've seen prozac used to help get off it (then you get off the prozac).

I have personally been on cymbalta, wellbutrin, viibryd, pristiq, prozac, abilify and something else I cannot remember at the moment. I am only on pristiq now. Weaning off the rest were fairly simply following the directions from my psychiatrist. If I had to pick, Abilify was the worst to be on and get off of. In my experience, it was getting on the meds that caused the most symptoms, Cymbalta being the worst. I hated that but stuck with it on advice from my psych and Internet advice (I know...) and it was probably the best drug of all of them.

I've seen/been with people who miss doses of meds and have moderate to severe symptoms. Brain shocks, dizziness, brain zaps, etc. were common for Effexor. Missing Cymbalta or Pristiq for a day or two caused a severe depression ""crash"". 

As OP stated; don't just stop taking something. Follow a path set by your provider or at least a reputable source.

The perpetual thoughts you once had of violent and nonviolent ways of dying can return. Are you on any medication at all? Passive SI usually stems from depression/anxiety issues..."
519,What if someone is thinking about suicide but don't have any diagnosed mental health issue. But due to circumstances getting out of control and problems in life they are considering it.,"Not entirely sure what you are asking here, are you asking is it possible to be suicidal without having any predisposed mental illnesses? yes.

&#x200B;

Suicide can be brought on by a number of varying things. You don't have to be mentally ill to commit suicide, it is most common in mentally ill people - but I tend to believe suicide is a predisposition and varying factors go against/for it. It's obviously not correct to want to kill yourself, but there's nothing inherent between suicide and Mental Illness, plenty of people with mental illnesses never attempt suicide. It is difficult to understand because they both go hand-in-hand with one another alot of the time, but having a predisposition towards suicide doesn't necessarily make you mentally ill, it could make you mentally ill further down the line if untreated.

&#x200B;

what you have to ask yourself is *why* do you feel these things. Are they stemming from something you need to work through, or are you just so self aware to the point you realise you can commit suicide as a viable option? If it's the latter then I think the majority of us go through this at one point or another. The realisation that if life gets a bit too much, you always have a card up your sleeve as a ""get out"" type thing. That in itself is very dangerous thinking and should definitely be talked about with a professional, there might not be any obvious mental illnesses to begin with, but this type of thinking definitely induces and enhances those thoughts."
520,How do you force yourself to cry?,"I'd say that whenever you notice yourself trying to stop crying, just take a moment and say what you would want to hear. ""It's alright to cry, it's valid and you deserve it"" - have a talk with yourself and ask yourself why you want to cry. really explore your own feelings. 

If you are stopping yourself from crying, you need to somehow reactivate the part that will allow you to cry - maybe just talk that part of yourself and let them know it's safe to cry."
521,Advice for alternative meds and also jobs?,"I can only offer you what I have learned from my own  experiences, but sleep and Dialectical behavior therapy have been the most helpful to me. Regular sleep is essential and I take over the counter sleeping pills to ensure this. 

For a job, I recommend writing for the web. Copywriting is pretty easy to get into and a lot of positions are remote. 

Hope that helps. Good luck."
522,ive told myself i was proud of me twice in the last week.,"I'm proud of you too! I think you have pretty reasonable goals (except one I'll get to that) btw, you just need to establish a timeline. Like, this summer could be job+clothes+working out/eating healthy. The school year can be confidence+ grades, while maybe working less/not working since school is more important. Idk what grade you're in but depending on which one,  next spring could be researching how to get into the carpentry business, and getting to that first step. Honestly, you're so young and waiting to get invisiline or braces wouldn't be too bad imo (I'm only saying that because they're expensive, but you can also look into insurance covering them if that's an option) so waiting a few years could work. These are just suggestions because obviously I don't know your life, I just wanted to bring this stuff up because a part of my anxiety is struggling a lot with feeling rushed, and I think that's why a lot of people get stressed out about their goals. You can slow down, you will accomplish them, just take them one at a time and break them into little goals.

Edit: I'm dumb I forgot something I was gonna say: don't prove other people wrong (they probably don't think that about you anyways). Prove yourself wrong. Prove to YOU that you're awesome and great and whatever else you want to be. I struggle with feeling like people hate me or are making fun of me. I really want people to like me, think I'm funny, and want to be my friend. What's helped the most is finding the good stuff about me that I like, and owning it, unapologetically. You'll feel better and the people that really like you will gravitate towards you. I just think it's a healthier mindset to say ""I'll prove the voice in my head wrong"""
523,Am i justified to say whatever to get someone to not kill themselves?,"If you’re being realistic, say what you need to, as long as it keeps your prerogative rolling. If you value his life, the best thing to do is help change it. No matter how much he curses at you or calls you names. But it’s also important to be more than sympathetic. Don’t let your feelings get in the way of realism. If you care, be there. Not just when it goes bad."
524,Feeling happy?,oh and I was able to go to a date and a social gathering and not drink at ALL
525,What do you do for your self care?,"I play guitar or Ukulele, just depends on what I need. I remember one time I had just gotten home and something really just made me mad. Dont remember what it was but I couldn't let it go. Anyways I remember walking in the front door, blew past my room mate w/o saying anything picked up my ax and played some rock n roll for about 10 minutes. After that I was golden, had a great day."
526,"I know theres people out there that have it worse than me, but here it goes anyways.",Wow. Hey just try to deal with it the best way you can. It's good you have support.
527,Anyone willing to discuss their mental health diagnosis?,"Hey Ill talk to you, I have bipolar 1 disorder. If that is something that interests you. I also have had trouble with addiction"
528,I don't know why I am sad and feel empty,"I have had similar feelings all of my life. I’m sorry that someone told you to get over it because that shouldn’t be the response. Reach out to other loved ones you feel comfortable with, try to document what may bring these feelings on and try to spend some time thinking of all that you are grateful for each and every day!! I hope you find your inner peace and happiness!"
529,Why is there no advocacy for active shooter lines/hurting other lines?,To be realistic. They would instantly have the cops called on them
530,Easier way to find a psychiatrist?,"psychologytoday.com has a good searchable database by location and insurance, with profiles."
531,Does Honesty Deserve Honesty Back?,"Honesty takes courage not a lot of us have in everyday interactions. Its so much easier to go and say you're fine when a friend notices you're slightly off, or just straight out lie in a reply when they ask you a question in which you know your honesty will destroy them.

Its not that they do not trust you, they are just not ready or to afraid to share."
532,Anyone else feel affected the same way by social media as they do walking through a crowd of people?,"Well, for the social media part, you can just delete your accounts. That's what I did, not just because of the feelings you have, but also it just annoyed me to see some of the asinine shit people post. My only social media now is reddit, which hardly counts.

It is definitely normal to feel that way. It is healthy to be lonely at times, but you have friends that you can connect with when you don't want to feel that way. Don't drown in the negative thoughts if you can help it.

Just remember that when you see all those happy faces in the crowd, many of them are struggling with the same things we do. Some people are better at faking it than others. We all have our own struggles, and the grass always seems greener."
533,My mom [62F] was divorced by my dad 7 years ago. Her mental health has spiraled since and I don't know what to do,"Inexpensive, available supplements at the right optimal doses *could* help with her mental problems:

534,"Trying to get antidepressants prescribed to me, pros/cons?","The first meds you try may not work for you. Most of the time it's a trial and error method with finding the right meds and doses. So if you try something and it makes you feel ""off"" try something else, dont give up entirely. Also those are the kind of chemicals that take months to build up in your system and actually do their thing so keep that in mind"
535,Stopping a anxiety attack in public,"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what does an anxiety attack look like in your case? Or how do you know an attack is coming?

I've read that it can help a little if you are aware of an attack and control your breathing before the symptoms get worse? Maybe this is BS, cause that's just something I read somewhere."
536,An actually good helpline (or textline) to use and give people?,i'd love to be thrown in the psychic ward.
537,Anxious about calling out today,Dont worry about not getting a response. You already did your part on letting them know that you can't go in.
538,Do you feel like this too?,"Many individuals suffering from mental illness or hardship have what outsiders would consider ""perfect lives"". Feeling guilt and like your feelings aren't validated, compared to those in more objectively bad situations, is normal and understandable. It's important to refrain from comparing your struggles to anyone else's. But that's much easier said than done and feeling this kind of guilt is a testament to your empathy. The fact that you're recognizing others' hardships and learning about the horrendous lives some people are forced into is meaningful. Knowledge means you can teach other people — you can share this information and support these communities by helping people understand what's happening in the world. I think redirecting your empathetic feelings into actions might help your guilt. Your pain is not any less valid than anyone else's, but if it helps, take action!"
539,Is fantasizing about being a Dictator and desiring to enact in it wrong?,"Rules are put on you by cowardly people with power. If you want something, get it. Life has no meaning beyond what you value. If you want power I suggest you earn it while you’re still able.

You don’t want to be laying on your deathbed saying “what if”.

If you’re looking for pointers, the drug and arms trade is always a huge economic point. Although risky. But life wasn’t meant to be safe."
540,Can someone try to analyze my behavior for me?,sounds like [dismissive-avoidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults#Dismissive-avoidant) attachment
541,I don’t know what wrongs with me,"I'm glad you came to this subreddit. Rest assured, nobody here is going to pass judgement on you. We all have distinct experiences with hardship, and this is a community that accepts people of all different backgrounds and diagnoses. 

I don't have enough knowledge about the autism spectrum or Aspergers specifically, but I would encourage you to perform from independent research on it. Hearing from anyone that you're ""something"" — whether it be depressed, autistic, borderline, etc. — is scary, especially so if you're unfamiliar with the diagnosis. Read about it and hopefully as you understand more, this is easier to accept. Or if you're confident this isn't Aspergers, get a second opinion from another doctor!

Regardless of whatever action you take, do not feel ashamed of yourself. This is much easier said than done, but if nothing else, don't feel ashamed to post here. I can't imagine the anxiety and confusion you're experiencing right now, so please use this subreddit as an emotional outlet if needed."
542,I'm not sure what to do anymore.,"Just because someone else is hurting, doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to hurt. You’re brother is in a life and death situation, and you’re mom is dealing with it all head on. I’m sure she does care it’s just a lot on her plate right now. My recommendation is to reach out to other people. If you love your boyfriend and he cares about you the same  he should want to know these feelings, (it shouldn’t hurt him) if not close friends, and if that cant happen I recommend professional help. Those people are there for a reason, they are there to help you. This is also the suicide prevention hotline (just in case you are in crisis and need someone to talk to right then) tel:1-800-273-8255 -I hope this helps"
543,Emptiness in the mind,"The only meaning you will get out of anything is what you what you give it. Sure, your job is meaningless if you think is. So is a doctors, lawyers, soilders.(no disrespect to the military). The only reason those professions matter is because we give them “meaning”. It’s the same for the rest of you’re life. You could tour Europe, and it could feel no different than if you were at home watching TV. Nothing matters unless you want it to. Look for something to look forward to, or attach some form of “sentimental” value to something to your life. Whether it’s your appearance, experiences, career goals, relationships. It doesn’t matter all that matters is that you need something to focus on. I also recommend to seek out professional help, the feelings of emptiness could be symptoms of an underlying illness that could have been dormant till now."

546,"Hello,I need girl for talking",Do you want to message me to talk?
547,In need of advice.,"Goodness me. Well I think both of you, you and your dad, need help. But firstly, you need to help yourself first. How can you help your father if you yourself aren't well? So don't feel guilty about it! Find a therapist, a friend, someone to talk to. And I'd you're feeling like shit, even if you dont want to, even if it feels like the hardest thing to do, get outside and walk. Just walk around the block. I don't care if that's the only thing you do that day. But your mind will feel so much clearer just by moving. Then you'll find you're outside longer. I am sorry I can't offer much more help. But please have faith in yourself. That things will be better. Everything, joy, happiness, is temporary. But so is pain and anguish. Hang in there."
548,PTSD and Speech Problems.....?,"I have the same diagnosis and the same problem. I wont slur words but my air way will close up and i find it hard to get a breath in let alone words. When i see medical professionals, sometimes I use a pen to write things down. I cant give any advice as i dont understand why this happens exactly, It can happen in other situations too such as a job interview or approaching a girl."
549,NHS refferals?,"Ask them what's happening with the referral, usually the process can take a few months. Check they have your details e.g phone number/address correct. They'll probably send a letter and phone."
550,Is it worth visiting a psychiatrist -feeling peace after psychotic break?,"Yeah you should still go, just because you’re feeling ok now doesn’t mean you will still be in the future. You can also bring that up with this psychiatrist and get their opinion on it too."
551,"My is suffering due to personal problems, should I tell my supportive boss?","If your boss has been supportive in the past, than I think it would be a good idea to let her know that you are having some difficulties at home, you don't have to give her specifics.

Maybe together you can come up with a solution, be it changing positions, or taking some personal time."
552,"My psychiatrist is leaving, do I get him a parting gift?",Maybe write him a note thanking him for the work you have done together. I did this when I terminated care with a therapist after 5 years and I know it meant a lot to her.
553,How do I get motivated to achieve my goals?,"you probably heard this before but discipline and responsibility work for me. it becomes much easier for me to stay active and work towards my goals if I know I HAVE to do something that day, so I might as well get up.

Personally I have to take care of my dog but you can apply it to a lot of things."
554,Please help. 11months postpartum with severe ppd,See your doctor they will prescribe a medication or therapy is also another option. Regardless it needs to be addressed by a doctor.
555,This makes me sad.,"I understand your problem intimately. I would experience flash moments of rage and unleash at unassuming people — people who didn't deserve to be the receiver of my emotion. After doing some independent reading on different mental illnesses, my doctor agreed I have bipolar disorder and demonstrate many characters of borderline personality disorder. Now, I take mood stabilizers that help tremendously and do daily self-guided dialectical behavioral therapy. It's an alternate to cognitive behavioral therapy that doesn't attempt to rationalize your emotions but rather accept them and use mindful techniques to work through them calmly. 

Forgiving yourself after hurting someone else is tough, but remember sometimes you're at the mercy of these uncontrollable* emotions. 

*But it's not hopeless — this rage can be contained with proper medication, therapy if needed and being mindful of your emotional state at a given time."
556,DAE come here and reply to posts when feeling down?,"Yep.  I try that as well.  Not sure *I* gain much from it but it can't hurt, right?"
557,Lady silently crying on the bus,That was so nice of you. I doubt the picking your nose was nessasery like but nonetheless you did a truly kind thing by sitting with her
558,Issues with talking about Mental Health,"Sympathy vs Empathy! Thanks for that. Very helpful.

Thanks for putting this together. I don't have the language to talk about it, which makes it tough to get all the way better."
559,Should I tell my care co-ordinator that I tried to kill myself last month?,"They're there to help, personally I would and have in the past told them because if not then the severity of what you're going through can't be addressed if they are unaware of it. Sectioning tends to only happen if you continue to be at that point of unstable but if you're aware of it and are making steps to get yourself better then thats something they can look at and maybe introduce some form of therapy? 
My psych. Tried to section me but I let it be known that I was aware that the place I was in wasn't good, I told him my plan to avoid getting to that point again and he was satisfied and just increased my visits/communication with my care coordinator and got some therapy sent my way and all was gravy"
560,Scared of the stigma of therapy,"Anyone can go to therapy regardless of whether they have mental illness or not & you also don’t need to tell anyone that you’re going, if you’re scared of what people will think of you. And “normal” people do go to therapy"
561,Scared of dating or forming friendships.,"I feel like I can sympathise with you. I don't really know how to answer or advise on what to do. But you're not alone. I've been single for over a year and now I'm in a ""talking stage"" and even though I think its exclusive I can't seem to shift the thought of not being good enough or her just leaving me. It's fine when I'm with her but I every time I'm not I always manage to convince myself she's just not as into me as I am with her. 

&#x200B;

I'm a 20m, I've never been diagnosed with anything but I'm convinced I probably have anxiety. I've suffered with patches of depression over the last year but I feel like whenever I try to form a relationship all my anxiety levels get ramped up to 11.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry I can't assist or advice, but I hope you don't feel alone."
562,"Friend (18F) feels symptoms of depersonalization/dissociation, looking for advice",Magnesium or cbd oil are some ways to help anxiety otc
563,I feel okay for the first time in my life and I just can't stop happy crying,Thanks for sharing.  So jealous. :)
564,How to stay tidy(ish) with Depression,"Awesome list, thanks for sharing!

  
Usually I'll focus on one room (or one thing, if it's a particularly bad day) at a time. I tell myself, ""You just have to do -insert chore or room here- and then you can lay back down and do nothing for the rest of the day"". Usually this works, and once I start doing the one thing it gets way easier to continue and do some more. Or I just do the one thing and get really drained and stop there. Either way, that's one less thing that's dirty/messy, and it helps me feel like I've accomplished something that day, however small. 

I'll also do little things like put toilet cleaner in the toilet before taking a shower. The moment I get out of the shower is usually the best I feel all day, so refreshed and clean. Then I can quickly scrub the toilet while I'm feeling good."
565,Advice and opinions of mirtazapine?,"Smaller dose will help with sleep, so take at night.  45mg dose is not unusual. Low side effect profile in the users that I work with. Give it two weeks, but as with most ssri, try and do things that you enjoy to increase the effect. Start trying to get some exercise."
566,Can someone really enjoy life and be happy with little to no interaction with anyone at all?,"Humans are not meant to be completely solitary, no. I'm sure there are outliers that can live and enjoy being completely alone, but that is unusual. Is there anywhere you can go to get human interaction? The library, some sort of event, even a book club or something? Any interaction can help.

And don't distance yourself from your boyfriend because you're having a hard time mentally. It only makes things worse for you. Let him decide if it's too much for him to deal with."
567,Granny keeps insulting me,"Does no one else in your family speak up against her when she says things like that?

Is this something your grandmother has always done, or is this new? If it's a behavior that is suddenly cropping up, I would be worried she is showing signs of dementia.

You are doing right by venting to your friend, but you also need to stand up for yourself if it is safe for you to do so. ""Grandma, I am extremely upset by the way you comment on my body. It is insensitive and insulting. Please keep your comments to yourself in the future."" It may not work, but at least you've tried. If you family won't stand up for you, I would go no contact with your grandmother (ignore her completely) and wait it out as long as you can until you can move out. 

If you haven't been there, I would look at the sub r/JUSTNOFAMILY. They have some great advice about dealing with shitty family members and what to do when you can't get away from them."
568,can't love,"I’m reflecting on personal experience & tbh I was the same at her age. I figured if I didn’t open up. Can’t get hurt. Nobody close enough to harm & far enough that I don’t worry about it. I would even sometimes make it clear that I wanted everyone to keep their distance.

The ideology behind it was: cherished nothing & no harm could befall me (emotionally that is)

Wasn’t until I was 23 I think is when I “grew out of it”. I met someone who took their time & was willing to move at a pace I felt comfortable with. They were prepared to be cut off based on my past experience & knew if they got too close that I would just shut them out with no chance of getting close again.

So a lot of time & patience. I had to learn to not jump at the urge to shut them out. There was arguing because that was my way of shoving them back & disregarding their feelings & wanting to close up again.

Fast forward: I finally spoke to somebody about my personal problems & that’s how I got my current diagnosis but claims that a lot of what I did was from PTSD. That the shoving, blocking, being jaded, etc was because of the home situation as a child. 
So yes it has a bit of maybe how she’s observed relationships & for whatever reason our brain decided to pick those memories of what we seen as a kid & decided to hold on to them. So what actually happening (maybe from my understanding based on personal experience) is her brain has created a self defense mechanism & it’s currently kicking in a lot. The amount of drinking she does could be evidence that in her own way knows it is & is trying to disable or drown it out aka self medicate during a social situation. It could also just be anxiety too.

So because I had the one partner whom took their time & definitely finding out I wasn’t being a asshole & that it was PTSD related. It made sense & easy to understand & recognize what was going on & make leaps & bounds in improving in that regard. So I would definitely suggest that your friend speaks to somebody about it."
569,Been off of mirtazapine for 2 weeks. Night terrors every night.,"Can your doctor not prescribe it without you coming in? My doctor would not let me go without medication even if I couldn't come in/had a balance. It's unhealthy and can cause severe effects. Withdrawal from mirtazapine can cause nightmares, much like most anti-depressants, but it shouldn't last much longer if you've already been off of it for two weeks.

It would be really unethical if your doctor would refuse to refill the prescription because of an unpaid balance."
570,Good enough?,Should also add that it feels impossible to completly love myself with my weight
571,How do I break up with someone who is invevitably goong to kill themselves if I do,"I think you both should seek therapy of some sort, it sounds like both need someone to talk to. Try whatever you can to get her to get professional help, but if she is resistive of it im sorry but it might be the best to move on from her, no relationship is worth dying over and losing friends over in my opinion."
572,Does anyone else have Stockholm syndrome for their depression?,"I think I understand where you're coming from. At a certain point, depression becomes comfortable in its familiarity. You're so accustomed to feeling hopeless, apathetic and miserable that thinking about feeling anything else can be stressful. Unfamiliarity and change are anxiety-inducing. 

However, this is not a reason to keep yourself captive to your depression. It's brainwashed you into feeding it and breeding it to become more powerful. It's lied to you and convinced you there's nothing else in the world except it. But — there is more. Not enough people comment on how terrifying and confusing recovery can be. It's not linear, graceful or easy. But once you're free and able to experience the world without being shackled to your depression, it's beautiful."
573,Overprotective parents,"Are you living with them? If so, are you able to find somewhere else to stay?

If not, have you spoken to your mother about this? Sometimes parents aren't even aware that they are being too smothering. If you have, or if you try to and she isn't responsive/things don't get better, you need to find a way to get away from her for your mental health. Get a job, find a relative or friend you can stay with temporarily. It's hard, but if you need to get away from her you'll find a way. Best of luck."
574,I'm spiraling. I don't know what to do.,"To be frank, they don't always get better. Not for everyone.

But they definitely don't get better if you don't try. Being hopeless will make things worse. I know it's easier to say that than to actually do it, and I've had my fair share of days where everything seems pointless and like nothing will get better. 

We have to persevere, or we will never get better."
575,am i delusioned to think my mental health will reward me with happiness one day?,"I believe it's likely.

It's true that when you work hard towards something, it's generally more satisfying when you get it. Having things handed to you makes you take it for granted. We struggle so much to get past our mental health issues, so I bet that once we get through it, we will appreciate the it more than those who have never dealt with it."
576,i'm having a rough time.,"That's a really tough situation. It's hard for me to offer anything but comfort, and I haven't been through anything like that.

I would suggest not bringing it up immediately to potential partners, but don't wait forever either. Like maybe not on the first or second date, but obviously bring it up before you pursue sexual relations.

Long-distance is actually a pretty good idea. That way you guys can get to know each other way better while not having the possibility of having sex. He would be more likely to continue the relationship if he's had time to get to know you first.

Sorry I can't help more. If you're concerned about depression, you should seek help. Actually, you might want to talk to someone regardless, as keeping all of these feelings to yourself isn't healthy. Having a neutral party listen and offer advice might help."
577,"Has anyone here ever been prescribed seroxat for more than 5 years. What effect did they have on you, and have you come off them since?","I've never taken it, but IIRC most of the controversial news isn't about the effects of the drug itself, but by fraudulent things done by the company. It's not safe for children and they marketed it towards children while knowing about it, and tried to suppress research that was done into the safety of giving it to children. They also tried to delay generic versions of it to be made available. So they company that owns it is shite, but that doesn't mean the medication is. Just my two cents."
578,Feel like I don’t have the right to grieve?,"It’s your right to feel sad... I feel like a hypocrite talking about this cause I’ve been through the same type of thing... I’ve had 7 friends die, though most of them weren’t super close friends... I’ve gone through this every time... even when my moms bff died I hardly knew her but it really shook me... I don’t get as shaken by it anymore (i mean 7)... my issue is that now I just constantly wonder who will be next... but I digress.  If you feel the need to grieve there is never shame in it, it doesn’t matter how much you felt you knew them or didn’t, they shared the same air and space as you, if you feel their loss is worth grieving it absolutely is, because individuals have worth."
579,"Slipping into a depression, isolating myself, and I don’t know how to reach out","I'm sorry you've been struggling. Depression is a monster that manipulates you into doing things — like isolating yourself — that feed it and make it stronger. It's a horrible thing to experience, and I'm sorry. But you posted here, and that's an accomplishment worth celebrating. Reaching out is hard, especially when it feels like you drag everyone else down, but it's an important piece to recovery, and it's amazing to discover how many people actually want to support you. If you're not comfortable reaching out to your friends, I encourage you to continue posting here. This is a safe community of people who are here to support one another, people of all backgrounds and diagnoses. We are here for you, and we're proud you posted here."
580,Should I let my therapist listen to an audio recording I made?,I think you should listen to it yourself and pull out the main points to talk about. This way you can actively talk about it in person rather than passively listen.
581,"Stuck in the city, but I belong in a field.","I have the same feelings with animals and people. The difference is, animals don't leave you voluntarily, but people do. 

I have the same issue of running away from relationships. I love the feeling of being comfortable with someone, the feeling that you only get when you've been together for awhile and know each other really well. At the same time, I have times where I just want to run away and start over where no one I know can find me. It's definitely normal to feel that way at times. Life and love can get overwhelming. And commitment is hard for many people. 

As long as you recognize that there is a disconnect there, I think you'll be okay. It sucks that our minds can logically tell us that something is true or untrue, but still not be able to completely believe it."
582,Is this normal?,"This can definitely be a symptom of depression. I have severe depression and before my current meds, I would feel like this for months. I would definitely recommend talking to someone about it, whether its family, a friend, or a doctor."
583,Schizophrenia... or what?,"As far as I understand it takes a very long time to be diagnosed for schizophrenia because they have to rule out every other cause first. You should tell your psychiatrist everything. They won’t tell anyone else and they need to know the whole story if they are going to help you. If they can diagnose you properly, they can better help you.

It sounds similar to schizophrenia if I compare it to what my grandmother went through, but these types of symptoms could be caused by a wealth of other things. There is potential it could even be something neurological rather than psychological, and if that’s the case you will want to get treatment before it gets worse. You really do need to consult a professional on this one.

Best wishes ❤"
584,I’m out of control,"I'm sorry to hear you're hurting. You said you were feeling paranoid and angry and that this stems from some traumatic experiences. You said you were finding it hard to manage your feelings, including anger. I'm also on the autistic spectrum. My experiences might be very different to yours, but I can relate to having and feeling very strong emotions. I remember a time when I was curled up in a ball crying and hating myself. It's scary feeling like you're out of control."
585,I don’t know how to tell my mom that I don’t want to/can’t go to college.,"Which country do you live in?

Regardless if possible just sit them down and tell them why you don't want to."
586,I lie constantly and need advice on what to do,"I think you've already taken the biggest and hardest step when it comes to addressing your issue. You've identified that the lies don't make things better, and that eventually they'll make things worse. That's a scary thing to come to terms with, especially when you know it's a habit that might be hard to break. It's a coping mechanism. It's a tool you use to make things easier to manage when you're scared. Having that tool and using it can make you feel like you have some control over the situation. But it's a bad coping mechanism; much like the hard drugs you may have lied about, it gives a little relief and then takes twice as much as it gave. 

Lying makes you a hostage to the lie. You need to remember and think about each lie all the time. You know that anything you say or do inconsistent with the lie has the potential to shatter the illusion and destroy your credibility in the eyes of the people around you. Maybe that's why your lies become elaborate. You need to tell lies on top of lies to keep the illusion going. I'd find it a constant source of worry. I'd worry that people will talk to each other, they'll Google a few things, someone will have some personal knowledge that'll expose the lie. And then I'd feel like I'd lost everything I'd built with that person the instant they found out. I'd feel terrible about myself.

You know you lie. You know why you lie. You know that it's bad. You know that you want to change. You just need to know how to change. Change is hard. The first thing I'd say is that it takes time. This isn't something that's going to happen overnight. You're going be rewiring you're brain. You're not going to wake up tomorrow and suddenly tell the truth like Jim Carey in Liar Liar. You'll be taking little steps, one after the other. You'll have set-backs, you might even have a full-on relapse. That's an important (although not altogether necessary) part of change. Every time you fail is an opportunity to learn more about yourself and your habit. Thomas Eddison discovered a hundred ways how not to build a light-bulb until he got it right. Don't beat yourself up if you fail. You're trying your best. Whatever you do, don't give up. You can do this, it'll just take time.

Rewiring your brain. It's not rocket science. It's brain surgery! It doesn't require a scalpel or forceps though. But it might sometimes feel like you're cutting through your skull with a bone saw. It requires doing things that you know will make you anxious. It requires you to do things that your brain believes will only bring you pain. It requires a little bit of faith that telling the truth will help you in the long-term, even if it doesn't feel like it right away. Every time you tell the truth you need to reward yourself. You need to think about the advantages of telling the truth. Turn every honest moment into a reflection on how you won't be a hostage anymore. Eventually your brain will relearn that honesty isn't painful. The truth will set you free."
587,I cant get the help I need.,"Visit r/Assistance. Someone there may be able to help.

If you live in the States, you can probably qualify for some form of government aid. They have emergency funds that can be deposited as soon as the next day, if your situation is urgent.

It definitely sucks, but prepare for the worst and look at some shelters in your area, that way if you find yourself in need you know which ones are good.

I doubt your interviewer saw your mental illness. Anxiety can cause paranoia. Keep your head up and continue applying for jobs. I probably sent out 100 resumes when I was unemployed and didn't even get an interview. I just got lucky and asked at a store I liked if they were hiring, and they were.

If you worked for more than three months at your old job you may also qualify for unemployment.

Do you not have any family/friends that can help a little?

&#x200B;

Edit to add: Have you told your doctor about your situation? You may be able to work out an arrangement to pay later. My doctor not only cut my fees because I was worried about being able to afford it, but if I need to wait until next payday to pay they let me. It doesn't hurt to ask."
588,I don't know.,"I get the same way. Everything is fine, but brain says be sad?? Have you seen anyone about it? I was reluctant to talk to anyone about it because I thought they would think I'm dumb or just a whiny baby, but you feel how you feel. Having a good life doesn't mean you can't get sad or depressed. It's your brains fault. Not yours."
589,Bad experience with Quetiapine/Seroquel,"I was prescribed Seroquel as an add on to my antidepressants.

I hated them! They made me drowsy, I had no emotion, my head was constantly cloudy. I took them for about 3 months and then told my Dr I wanted to stop. The withdrawal from them wasn't that pleasant either if I remember right."
590,help please,"ive lived in the same situation as you my entire life. its severely caused me issues. its tough dealing with issues that arent your decision or in your grasp

&#x200B;

the only advice i can give you is to be social with your friends, family, and date, this can promote a healthier you. sometimes it may be hard, but dating for example is a good form of counseling when you have somebody you can talk to constantly and show love to eachother. 

&#x200B;

there is also counseling, psychiatry, psychology, and more. dont forget were always here for you =) good luck"
591,anybody have their teeth clentch tight from medication?,"I clench and grind my teeth from anxiety and stress. The medication actually relieves it. When I'm really anxious, I wake up with severe jaw pain from clenching my teeth in my sleep, it's awful."
592,"Testosterone therapy? Depression, high pitched voice","Have you had low testosterone confirmed? If so, testosterone therapy may be indicated.

If you haven't had low testosterone confirmed, get your T levels tested by your doctor. If they're within normal ranges for your gender, I wouldn't recommend going on T.

Voice coaching can help with your voice. If you don't want to try voice coaching, there are books (generally pitched at trans people) that can help you train for a lower voice very effectively. The Voice Book for Trans and Non-Binary People is apparently excellent, for example.

I found that being on T didn't help my concentration, sleep issues, or fatigue. However my issues with those are not due to low T as such, although I am AFAB. I still wonder if you might be expecting more from T than it is likely to provide."
593,"hi, im the new kid and i wanted to say thank you","If you are interested in reading more stories or sharing your own stories, check out conquereddemons.com (not trying to sell you anything. Just offering another resource).

Reddit really is great for support. I second this statement 👆"
594,Does where you choose to live determine your happiness?,"I'd say no.Sure it is refreshing to go somewhere new,but to actually live there?You'll fall into the same routine."
595,I need advice on paying for my medications,I don't have any advice but I wish you the best. If they have prescribed you medication continue to take you regular dose and contact your county's health services.
596,writing a book about my trauma and mental health,I'd be interested in reading it when you're finished with it. Congrats on writing a book! That's so exciting.
597,can someone please help i just want to be happy,"Start a goal progress diary. Give yourself a goal every day, no matter how big or small, and rate your positive emotion on a scale of 1-10 when you've completed the goal. It's a small thing but it will hopefully help. Good luck!"
598,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"If you attempted suicide, you are ill. Please talk to your parents and doctor. If you can't talk to your parents, you have an unhealthy family dynamic that may be contributing. Talk to someone you trust, even a friend's parents or teacher."
599,My depression won't leave,"It doesn’t leave.  You work to manage it.  The first and frankly only person who needs to give a shit is you.  I wish you didn’t feel this way, just like you wish it but it doesn’t change through wishing.

I highly encourage you to make a serious go at practicing mindfulness meditation.  Set yourself some simple daily goals and achieve them.  Do 1 push-up a day for a week.  Double that next week.

There is definitely one human being in this earth who depends on you to carry on.  You need to begin caring about that person.  You are the only one who can help them."
600,Hello frist time poster. Please be gentle with me.,"Have you seen a professional? If you are so focused and worried about these things that it's affecting your daily life and causing you to make decisions that you wouldn't otherwise make, I think you need to speak to someone who can help you.

While the things you are talking about are definitely real and serious problems, they aren't so pressing that you can't live your life normally. Sure, you can dedicate time to bringing more awareness to the subjects and doing things in your life to reduce your impact on the environment, but focusing on these things the way you are isn't mentally healthy. You can't change the world by yourself, but you can definitely help in small ways. :)"
601,Does anyone actually feel content with their own company?,"Not quite sure what advice to give you, but just wanted to know I read your post so that maybe you don’t feel so alone. 

I don’t think it’s you. You’ve got your boyfriend and kids who “stick around” and obviously love you. Sometimes people just don’t know how to communicate so don’t assume you’re losing friends. Try again to reach out, it might be worth it. Sorry you’re hurting and above all else I hope you feel relief soon."
602,Summer makes me so sad that I start to believe the things my mind tells me.,I’ve been feeling the same exact way. It’s like there’s nothing to do in the summer and things just move so slow so you start believing in the things your brain is telling you. Do you have anything that could distract you but not overwhelm you or make you spiral down?(you said that getting outside makes it worse so maybe reevaluate what about it is making things worse - don’t gonna write it here but just something to think about)
603,Extreme exhaustion when I don’t take vyvanse,"Im not a doctor but it’s probably because you’re putting your body through so much going off and on the pills. I take venlafaxine and side effects of a single missed dose can be dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, etc. which I have experienced personally. Don’t look up the side effects of the drug, but look up the side effects of a missed dose. Took me like 3 times to realize what I was doing to myself when I accidentally missed one."
604,"I’m almost 24 and feel like I’ve wasted my life overthinking, being anxious or depressed, having no direction in life, wanting to cut or commit suicide, being emotionally isolated from family, having no social life, feeling angry all the time, wasting money on a useless degree…","Just turned 23 and I totally empathize with you. My lifelong melancholy has twisted my worldviews, and addiction has ruled most of my life. It's reassuring to know that I am not alone in these great feelings of disconnection and uselessness. I hope things get better for you, and for all of us."
605,"""Flight"" response to easy job, after very stressful year?","We cannot diagnose on Reddit, but it sure sounds like you have adhd. Most people with adhd love to work with their hands, but have difficulty in the classroom or in the office. I suggest seeing a mental health professional and get tested. You have to work with someone that knows how to treat someone with adhd that also may have anxiety. Good luck."
606,I’ve built the worst possible foundation for myself.,"Depression not only holds you back, but also makes you feel shite about yourself and blame yourself for all of life's problems. Focus on one thing at a time. What is your most important goal right now? Try to take tiny steps towards achieving it. Any effort is better than none, and you'll feel better for doing it. I know it's easier said than done, I struggle with it regularly. But I always feel better for accomplishing something, no matter how small. And that makes me more likely to accomplish more. Much like how wallowing makes you feel worse and makes you wallow more. Good luck."
607,my mental health is declining bad right now...,"Please go see someone. You absolutely need help right now.

Other than that, try to do small things. Focus on one thing at a time. I don't have any experience with schizophrenia or the like, but I suffer from major panic disorder and depression. I try to ground myself any way I can when I'm dealing with derealization. It's hard to snap yourself out of it, but you have to try. Staying in bed and not eating will not help. Take a shower. Eat something, anything you can stomach, even if it's small.  

You have enough awareness right now to make this post, so you're still fighting in there somewhere. Just push yourself a little at a time. And go talk to someone."
608,Take next semester off from uni to work on anxiety?,"Not sure if you should take the semester off bc from personal experience, taking a semester off kind set me back a bit. However, if you feel like you’d be okay with that and want to work on yourself and the proceed in a hopefully better and brighter state of being, I think taking a semester off could be really good.

If you do end up staying, I’d say 100% to work on the anxiety during bc it’d be a lot better than going back and not having any support or coping mechanisms for the anxiety.

Best of luck."
609,Emotional Abuse and Guilt,"I'm sorry you're going through that. It's really difficult to acknowledge that the people you love are abusive, but it's a step forward towards a better future without toxic people in your life.

Hopefully it's easier to get through it now that you have a goal and a plan in place to get out of it."
610,ab to lose my mind,Sometimes the world feels like it's literally crashing down upon you and somehow you can't even get your bearings beforehand. Go ahead and vent. Word vomit until there's relief those negative thoughts have been released from inside your head. This community supports you.
611,Panic Attacks - Real?,"I also have panic disorder. That's usually how my panic attacks feel. You definitely wouldn't know I was having one to look at me. I feel dizzy, light-headed, a severe sense of dread and impending doom for absolutely no reason. Usually lasts around 10 minutes. I used to have the heart-beating, hyperventilating kind, but it changed for some reason.

I do agree with the other commenters that you should get checked out just in case. It can't hurt."
612,"Should people who score high in neuroticism, just kill themselves, since we will basically never be happy no matter what we do?","No.

Living an unhappy life doesn't mean you don't have worth.

I'm not a happy person, but for my job I look after the disabled. They tell me that I'm their favourite staff because I'm nice.

With some of my first paychecks I bought my mother a car and built my sister a computer.

I try to avoid hurting people by keeping myself to myself and generally acting in a conscientious matter.

Yes, I don't particularly want to live, but if I was dead I wouldn't be able to do these things.

Worth and purpose doesn't always have to be defined by the attainment or pursuit of happiness."
613,"Emorionally dammed up, no clue where to start.","Get help. There are low-cost services out there for low-income people. You are not broken, you just need to sort some things out. And the first step in that is to find a professional. It's scary and can be difficult, but just think about how much it's worth to start your path to healing.

When I first started going to see someone, I just did a google search and read reviews on psychiatrists in my area, and took note of what they specialized in. Many of them advertise they prices online, but if not, you can call and ask. I lucked out and got on really well with the first one I tried, and I'm still seeing her two years later. You may want to start with just a therapist, as they are cheaper. If you need more help than they can give, they can give you a recommendation for a psychologist or psychiatrist. If you don't mesh well with whoever you see or it just doesn't feel right, don't be afraid to seek a new one. You have to feel comfortable with who you are speaking with in order to get the best help possible."
614,Having trouble hanging on to motivation,"its common with mental illness... to lose motivation

&#x200B;

i tend to combat this by doing everything in pieces... like ill play video games for 30 minutes, watch tv for 30 minutes, go on the computer for 30 minutes, listen to music for 30 minutes, then repeat.

&#x200B;

a schedule can be helpful to pinpoint your motivation as well. i notice that between 12pm-5pm i am more useful to cook, clean, ect., so around that time i make all my meal and do laundry, ect.

&#x200B;

good luck"
615,mental phenomenon,"Nobody here can diagnose you, only a professional can. But those things are quite normal for depression, anxiety, etc. The spacing out and going on autopilot thing can be connected to derealization, which is feeling like you aren't really there or you're watching a movie rather than living your life. I would suggest seeing someone to figure out what the cause is."
616,Psychiatrist told me to try wait out my meds for another week...,"I'm so sorry it's not going well.  I hear you, my last med made me so sick.  It's a nightmare sometimes. When my psych tells me to try and wait, I don't unless it is manageable.  How long have you been on it?  Different meds take different amounts of time to work.

I really hope it gets better, and that you find the right help. Best of luck on your journey."
617,Do I quit my job? Is there anyway to fix this?,"For those of us who have mental health issues, the feelings of ""worthwhile"" and ""fulfilling"" tend to take on a more fluid definition that creeps towards the negative. I know that for myself, it's always going to be that way. If I start basing my life decisions off of what my emotions are telling me then not only am I granting them more power, but I'm becoming a slave to them.

&#x200B;

If you quit. Quit for a positive reason, maybe you want to learn/experience something new. But if you can - run towards something, instead of away - as  that tends to have it's own set of downfalls."
618,I'm suicidal... get over it,"People will always take this stance in my experience, I just deal with life one day at a time and sink my time into things I find some form of comfort in like video games, a way to escape the crushing feeling of the world around me.
When I log off and find my self back in my own head with thoughts rushing around I think of next loggin back in, you are only human and everyone deals with stress, anxiety and general life differently.
I've contemplated taking my own life on more than one occasion but dealing with life one day at a time makes it less of a burden, not easy but less arduous and a better coping mechanism.

I hope this helps you find a place mentally where you feel like you can continue on in this life."
619,My girlfriend had a paranoid episode that she can't remember,"I didn't know anxiety, depression or citalopram could cause symptoms like that. I think it's ok to tell her that you are concerned and that maybe she should speak to her doctor. I wouldn't push too hard tho."
620,How do I find a new therapist and still be able to say goodbye to old one?,"I don't think you need to change therapists right now, but it's a good idea to start checking out some other ones in advance of your current therapists retirement. Though I'm not familiar with insurance and all of that, if you can work it out to see your therapist and check out some new ones, that would be best."
621,Social Anxiety taking over,"I suffer really badly too. I've been in a dark place for a while, and one of the only things I've come up with for battling this is to keep remembering my reason for leaving home. Like for me, going to the store was fucking awful. But i keep remembering ""need milk... gotta have milk... can't go home without milk"" 

It gives you a personal primary goal to work for, making the social interaction more of a means-to-an-end."
622,Death,"Yep, I'd love to go too but I can't do it to my future self or the people who love me."
623,The bad thoughts are back.,"Hey man,

I'm not sure I'll be much help, but here goes. I get those thoughts that rise and fall depending on your state, or what you life is like at the time. Recently I've been overwhelmed and feeling like I'm letting everyone in my life down in different ways (some of who have told me such, some who haven't). It's been a rough little while, with smaller fights with family and friends building and building and my hobbies and things I'm proud of taking a back seat and regressing which has pushed me further into the dark. 

I'm trying to take some time to myself, or as to myself as I can, and just breathe. Find what I'm proud of in myself again, and perhaps be able to smile and be happy in moments without it covering up how sad I am on the inside. Perhaps just be happy for happiness' sake.

I definitely understand the over sleeping, and over eating, and the idea that death is the way to go at times. Eating I'm trying to reign in again, hopefully over sleeping and the constant tiredness will fade as time goes on. I guess all I can say is I'm here, struggling through it too. Trying to make the days a bit brighter in the ways I can. Hey, you woke up today. I didn't cry for the fourth time in as many days. Small victories is what I'm pushing for now. 

I don't know you, but best of luck to you. I'm rooting for you."
624,Very very intense emotions every day. Help!,"None here can tell you exactly what it's. It might sound familiar to someone with a disorder but must disorders share symptoms, it might just be who you are.

&#x200B;

The only person who can really tell you what this is about, is a professional, only they can provide a diagnosis."
625,I'm dating a Hypochondriac. What can I do to help him stop worrying so much?,"He should get a CBT professional. Hypochondria is related to severe anxiety/ocd. He needs to learn to challenge his thoughts every day. 

It takes time and practice but with patience he will get better at separating legitimate concerns from obsessive worry."
626,Opening up about childhood trauma,"Firstly, I'm sorry you suffered like this at such a young age, or even at all. Secondly, wow, you're not alone. I was also a child of abuse, and I remember those thoughts, that there was no world without my mother and her home. I would have dreams that even after I had escaped her, she'd come back with a smile and say ""you thought you could live without me?"". I don't understand your pain fully, I mean obviously how could I. But, having been diagnosed with PTSD myself, I know how hard it is to admit to yourself that you are the victim of such disorder. I remember being told to ""stop exaggerating/making stuff up"", and now (as an adult) when I recount stories about my abuse to people, in the back of my mind my mom's voice tells me ""stop making stuff up"". You're not exaggerating anything, this is YOUR TRUTH. Feel free to message me and we can talk more about it, if that feels like something that might help you."
627,feeling like i'm about to die,"Travel anxiety is a very legitimate experience. The best advice I can offer is practice breathing techniques to calm yourself on the plane or pack anything to keep you distracted — a book, handheld video game, music, etc. I used to experience travel anxiety and noticed it happened mostly leading up to the trip, but once I got to my destination, it disappeared almost completely. Don't ignore these feelings but don't give them the authority to ruin the memories you're going to create."
628,Something people need to understand about depression,"I’ve struggled with mental illness for 30 years or so. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. Dealing with it as a kid was easier because I could always come home and hide, be protected in a way. As an adult it’s debilitating. You have to provide an adult life for yourself. You don’t have that safeguard as a minor. Now being in my 40s I seriously can’t distinguish the years because so much of it was just staying in bed, avoiding,and numbing. The decisions I’ve made, the situations I put myself in, the people I surrounded myself with seriously make me want to cry. The people I’ve blamed, the people that enjoyed seeing me suffer just breaks my heart. The confidence stollen from me, the aloof attitude to protect my sanity is in part, part of the mental health issues. I feel like I’m getting better at handling it but still such a struggle, still such a long road ahead. At times I just feel like I’m a child inside trying to function in an adult world. Without learning how to succeed and strive I generally come up short. I think people just don’t understand how mental illness affects your approach to life. I’m starting to get it but that clarity is so clouded. You just don’t think or approach life rationally when you struggle with mental health issues. It’s very tough."
629,Can't bring myself to gain weight.,What you’re describing is an eating disorder. Are you in therapy or anything for your anxiety? You need to see a doctor/therapist for your issues with weight.
630,I think i might have a mental disorder.,"I think you might have been suffering from some anxiety attacks. The panicky-ness and the restlessness kind of gives it away, as these are the two symptoms everyone picks up when I'm about to have one (please note, I am practically a couch potato, and will happily sit and watch TV all day if I didn't have to work). From my viewpoint, you haven't likely had these issues, or that they weren't that prevalent before for you to have noticed until only recently.

Due to your age, and trying to relate this to me and the current time of year, I would ask, have you recently had exams, or are currently awaiting results for exams?"
631,This weird thing I do probably isn’t healthy?,"I'm not a psychiatrist but I would stake my life on the fact that every living person without retrograde amnesia experiences this. I used to ask myself this question all the time, and the fact of the matter is that everyone is a lot more idiosyncratic than you'd think and everyone experiences mental/emotional pain to varying degrees."
632,Am I developing schizophrenia?,"From what I'm hearing, it's not schizophrenia. Your realization that it is a paranoia is spot on, though. I would take the pills recommended, they might help a lot! (Cousin has schizo)"
633,Pissed off and sad after having a good time,"Could have to do with a natural withdrawl. Or drug related idk you're situation. 
I get that way too.."
634,Why do i keep wanting to end my life and feel sad i cant stop,"Hi there, 

I'm not going to ask you to not have those thoughts because I am a stranger and I don't know you, or your battles.

However, may I ask that you just spend 3 minutes concentrating on your breathing? 

On taking one deep breath in, and another out. 

It's just a little thing. 
Little things count, lots of things count in this world. But I believe that it's the little things that count the most. So you might think you're not worth it. Nothing is. But somewhere, it is. To someone you are.

Hell, i don't know what this will do - but if it can remind for even a second that you are not alone, and that you deserve to be here. Then that's all I asked for."
635,I’m 24 and increasingly feeling anxious and angry,Is there any pattern to your moods and your periods?
636,How do you deal with feeling so much love for a pet?,"I think it's normal if you don't another type outlet for your love/frutration. I love my dog to death but when I find myseld occupied with anything else, I can ovelook my feelinga for him and realize he's just a dog."
637,How do you make friends and connect with people when you are suffering from mental illness? Feel very alone right now,"Realistically, your emotions might be too intense for some people to handle, but those aren't people you need supporting you right now. If you struggle to approach people in person-to-person interaction, become more active on this subreddit. You might not make lifelong friends but this is a great community with unconditional support that stems from a common understanding of the pain we've all experienced."
638,People think I’m lazy because I hate working and can’t hold onto a job for more than a year. But nothing makes me want to off myself more than the feelings of being replaceable and having no purpose at some job that doesn’t even pay me enough to live.,"I feel you on this. My parents are both health care professionals and make decent bank. Yet im the one that has worked at a factory and feel like it try harder than them every day, but to no avail. 

 I cant fit into society bc I tried to go for harder AP classes and passed with bs and cs instead of sticking to easy classes. Couldnt get scholarships, couldnt get into good schools, couldnt become what I should have become."
639,Why do people feel like it’s okay to tell me I’m okay?,"Although I'm hopeful the stigma surrounding mental illness is diminishing, unfortunately there's still a lot of misinformation and misconceptions about it. It's frustrating and offensive sometimes when people assume ""it's only a phase"", and it's a poor demonstration of compassion to say ""it'll get better soon"". I'm sure most people who've experienced mental health issues can relate. Luckily, having firsthand experience makes us experts at spreading the truth regarding mental illness! You can fight against the stigma and teach these people what it actually means to not be okay."
640,How can I cope with the Existential nightmare of the worlds current state?,"Holy shit, this hit home...."
641,I don't know what I have,"I know it can be hard to go to your parents but I think that's what you need to do now. My parents started off the same way but I think if losing you is the alternative they might sit up. You'd be surprised.

If you're still in school you might have a counsellor that can help for free. 

It's important that you don't self diagnose but also get the help you need."
642,Still battling tinnitus.,I have it too. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. It's the worst thing ever.
643,Why was I such a weird and difficult child?,"Sounds like you may be on the spectrum low to moderate side though , my son is just like you ."
